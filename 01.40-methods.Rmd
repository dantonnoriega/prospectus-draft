## Methods {#methods-1 -}

### Part 1: Mixed Methods {-}

A mixture of methods will be used. This is a consequence of the store selection issue outline in the data section.

### Part 2: Methods for Selection on Observables {-}

Analysis of stores selected using *known* and *observable* criteria.  

2. **Sample**: 11 Treated stores, 12 Control Stores across 3 years, weekly values
    3. Within-group and between-group variation
        4. We lose some within-group variation as the 2 pilot stores are only ever observed as treated stores.
    4. Stores enter in waves. The staggering is used to produce extra variation between groups.
    5. T is 58 x 3 (weeks)
        6. Weeks is important because of MI SNAP schedule
    7. N is the same across time but the staggering shifts N for treated and control.
        8. **Table**: Create table showing the change in N subsample.   
4. **Method 1**: Difference in Differences with FE
    5. DinD seems appropriate.
    6. FE should remove any store-specific time-invariant attributes.
3. **Method 2**: Regression Discontinuity
    4. **Fear 1:** using a running variable that is a function of other variables. Only seen one paper reference anything beyond one running variable [@papay_extending_2011]. Never seen a running variable that is score function.
    5.  **Fear 2**:  sample size here is small. RD performs better with large sample size.
### Part 3: DinD with matching

Tiny analysis of the 3 stores that self-selected and were matched to 3 other stores.

3. **Method:** Difference in difference been years 2015 and 2016
    3. Power here will be small. Total N will be 6. Nothing will be significant. But need to be transparent.
