### Set up {-}

Recall the research question of interest---whether the DUFB incentive increases spending on fresh fruits and vegetables (FV) within stores participating in the program. The outcome variable, in this case, is total spending on FV.

I've considered other possible values for the outcome variable. For example, the proportion of dollars spent per transaction or the total ounces of FV purchased. Each added an extra layer of complication. Using proportion of expenditure per given transaction would vary wildly, particularly with small transactions, and would creating two mass points at zero and one (no FV purchased and only FV purchased). Total ounces depends on the variable and quality of the data. I cannot be sure the data received will contain counts or ounces for fresh fruits. Fresh fruits generally do not have UPC values. Dollars spent (expenditures) on FV gets to the heart of the question and is the data guaranteed to be in the data.

Unfortunately, using the total expenditure of FV is complicated by 3 problems.

1. Purchases not linked to customers.
2. Outcome Variable with non-trivial amount of zeros (corner solutions).
3. Consumers maximize across multiple product types.

The first problem is not specific to the outcome variable. The inability to link purchases to individuals means I cannot use Panel Data Methods at the customer level; I will be unable to look at how customers behavior changes over-time and cannot control for unobserved customer heterogeneity. I'm instead limited to methods for repeated cross-sections over-time.

The second and third problems are directly related to the preferred outcome variable. I anticipate a non-trivial amount of zeros because I expect to observed a large fraction of transaction where no FVs are never purchased. Likewise, FV expenditures are often a part of a basket of goods. Just as I anticipate a non-trivial amount of zeros, I also anticipate that FVs are not purchased independently of other goods. When spending their money, consumers optimize expenditure across a large set of options. This optimization is also complicated by the first problem (cannot link) but I will go into more details later.


### Methods Overview {-}

**Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences** 

I want to measure the difference in SNAP EBT dollars being spent or redeemed on fresh produce. If the incentive is working, then I should see in increase in SNAP EBT dollars spending on fresh produce within stores implementing the DUFB incentive. I do not think it is enough to assume the DUFB incentive, if effective, will be measurable without considering heterogeneity. That is, if a store's implementation of DUFB affects individual behavior, the effect could be hard to measure if measured across the entire distribution of FV purchases, instead of the subset of SNAP EBT dollars spent.

The Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences (DDD) regression is a fitting framework if I expect the SNAP population that patrons DUFB (experimental) stores to be systematically different from the SNAP population that patrons the non-DUFB (non-experimental) stores.^[See @wooldridge_econometric_2010 for more details. I'm assuming familiarity with the DDD model.] Differencing along time, store experimental group, and the type of transaction (SNAP or not) will reasonably capture any systematic differences.

This is unfortunately complicated given that I cannot link transaction to individuals. But I can tell if a purchase was made with SNAP EBT dollars or that it redeemed DUFB points. This is enough to split transactions into SNAP/DUFB-redeemed versus other standard transactions. This provides a way of grouping to perform a DDD.

Any model like DDD that is estimate via OLS, however, ignores the second and third problems. I think it is prudent to consider consumer choice behavior and the mechanisms that generate zero-expenditures. Numerous demand models exists for cross-sectional data that, with a few assumptions (like each transaction represents a distinct individual), may better estimate the impact of the DUFB incentive than straight OLS.

There is a vast literature on consumer purchasing behavior aka choice models (see @train_discrete_2009 for an introductory overview). Multiple-discrete choice models, in particular, have become popular given the increased availability of transaction-level (scanner) data [@dube_multiple_2004;@hendel_estimating_1999]. Multiple-discrete choice models, however, are too product-specific. It is not important for me to model which brand and quality of bananas or carrots were purchased. What is important to me is how much was spent on bananas, carrots, and other fruits and vegetable types versus other non-FV types. Remember, my outcome variable is expenditure on *total* FV spending. I'm far more concerned about whether or not consumers are observed buying *any* FV than I am with the exact types. That said, expenditure on non-FV is also important. *Therefore, what is needed are model framework flexible enough to handle a continuous outcome variable with a non-trivial amount of zeros (corner solutions) and multiple types of goods.*

**Continuous Outcome Variables and Corner Solutions**

Corner solutions for expenditures can occur for various reasons. @pudney_modelling_1989 covers three of the most likely mechanisms producing "true" zeros in cross-sectional data. The first is that the data was gathered in too short a period of time for the purchase to occur. This problem is far more common in cross-sectional data of infrequently purchased goods (i.e. durable goods like cars or refrigerators). The second is due to a supply side factor the customer has no control over. For example, there could be a shortage of FVs or none are available. Imagine searching for FV purchases in collection of convenience store data. Many zeros would exists because some convenience stores do not sell FVs. The third zero results from a customer's decision as a function of prices, preferences, and income constraints. A zero is perhaps observed because FVs are too expensive and the customer can get larger quantities of other, equally or more preferred, foods for the same price. 

I expect first mechanism could apply to food purchases under specific circumstances. If data are left disaggregated or the period of observation is shrunk substantially, zeros for FVs will exists due to infrequency of purchase. For example, customers that make frequent trips to the store may not always buy FVs. A cross-section of data from one day may have a non-zero FV value for the customer but zero the next. The third mechanism applies very naturally to the grocery store environment (classical utility theory). The second will require further verification. I do not expect to find out that there were shortages of FVs in the stores observed, but I could be wrong.

@humphreys_dealing_2013 and @carlevaro_multiple_2016 discuss cross sectional models that accommodate corner solutions---Tobit, *Two-Part*, and *Hurdle* models, specifically.^[@wooldridge_econometric_2010 does not appear to differentiate between "Two-Part" models and "Hurdle" models. I will use it following @humphreys_dealing_2013 language, which does.] The classic "corner solution" regression model is the Tobit model. Corner solutions are utility maximizing and no assumptions are made about the decision not to purchase/consume. In contrast to the Tobit model, the decision to participate in consumption is explicitly formulated in the Two-Part and Hurdle models. Participation is the "first hurdle", the amount purchased/consumed is the "second hurdle". 

In the Two-Part model, the decision to buy is estimate separately and sequentially from how much (amount) to buy; Probit is used to estimate the decision-to-buy process and OLS is used to estimate the amount purchased. The Double Hurdle model estimates both these decision simultaneously via maximum likelihood. The "full" Double Hurdle model allows for correlation between the error terms in the decision and amount/consumption equations [@jones_note_1992]. Imposing the assumption that unobservable factors between the decision and amount decisions are uncorrelated reduces the "full" Double Hurdle to the "Cragg" model [@cragg_statistical_1971].

It is unclear to me if Two-Part or the Double Hurdle models that formalize "participation" are necessary when considering FV purchases. This makes more intuitive sense for something like cigarette or alcohol consumption, where zero-expenditure can be the result of abstention or price/income constraints.^[See @garcia_alternative_1996 and @aristei_cohort_2008 for abstention-style hurdles.] There are, after all, consumers who will never consume cigarettes or alcohol, even if free (abstention). But I'm not sure if an abstention mechanism is reasonable when considering FV purchases. Do consumers really opt out (or abstain) form buying FVs altogether?

An infrequency of purchase mechanism for FVs, however, seems more reasonable. @deaton_statistical_1984 introduced this mechanism as an expansion to the Tobit model. This Double Hurdle has been used to model infrequent purchases of butter, pork, and prepared meals [@yen_modeling_1995; @su_microeconometric_1996; @newman_double-hurdle_2003]. I find it reasonable to expect that, for any given daily cross-section of data, some of the zeros observed will be due to infrequent purchase of FVs.

**Multiple Goods**

The limitation of Tobit and other hurdle models is the estimated demand of a single good. Ideally, expenditure on different types of goods better captures the decisions and purchasing behavior of customers within a grocery store. That is, instead of collapsing all expenditure on FVs into one outcome variable, the model would allow for customers to optimize across *multiple* goods of different types, while also allowing corner solutions. Multiple discrete choice models allow the purchase of multiple types of goods, but do not capture the intensive margin (the amount) of the good purchase/consumed.

@dubin_econometric_1984 construct a *discrete-continuous* model were consumers can select from multiple goods/options but that they are mutually exclusive, perfect substitutes. The *discrete* component of the model captures the decision to buy a non-zero amount; the *continuous* part captures the amount purchased/consumed/utility acquired. The mutually exclusive, perfect substitute condition, however, means that one cannot be observed buying/consuming more than one good/option. 

For any observed trip to the store, zero-expenditure in FV implies non-zero expenditure for some non-FV. Ignoring this seems unwise and I plan, at a minimum, to implement a model optimize along two dimensions---FV and non-FV. The best model I've found is the *multiple* discrete-continuous model extreme value (MDCEV) model introduced by @bhat_multiple_2005. MDCEV is an extension of the Kuhn-Tucker based model developed by @wales_estimation_1983. MDCEV allows non-zero consumption across multiple goods. @kim_modeling_2002 solved the intractability of the @wales_estimation_1983 model. @bhat_multiple_2005 simplified both to be more realistically applicable.

In the next subsection, I will formally introduce the different modeling structures I intend to use in my paper. I will first introduce the DDD framework were estimation via OLS is sufficient. I then expand from OLS to Tobit and other Hurdle models before expanding into the more complex MDCEV model. The share goal, across all models, is the best possible measurement of the impact the DUFB incentive has on fruit and vegetable expenditures between participating and non-participating stores.
