## Methods {#methods-1 -}

A mixture of methods will be used. This is a consequence of the store selection issue outline in the data section. The main analysis will comprise the stores where we have been made aware of how and why they were selected. A smaller analysis, in attempts to make use of as much data as possible, will be done using the 3 “self-selected” stores that were then matched using CEM.

### Part 1: Methods for Selection on Observables {-}

Analysis of stores selected using *known* and *observable* criteria.  

1. **Sample**: 11 Treated stores, 12 Control Stores across 3 years, 
    3. Within-group and between-group variation
        4. We lose some within-group variation as the 2 pilot stores are only ever observed as treated stores.
    4. Stores enter in waves. The staggering is used to produce extra variation between groups.
    5. T is 58 x 3 (weeks)
        6. Weeks is important because of MI SNAP schedule
        7. By the 4th week in every month, purchases with SNAP drop. It is important to capture this and not average it out by looking at monthly purchases.
    7. N is the same across time but the staggering shifts N for treated and control.
        8. **Table**: Create table showing the change in N subsample.
4. **Method 1**: Difference in Differences with FE
    5. DinD seems appropriate.
        6. Larger and local economic forces should affect stores within each cluster equally. 
    6. FE should remove any store-specific time-invariant attributes.
3. **Method 2**: Regression Discontinuity
    4. **Fear 1:** using a running variable that is a function of other variables. Only seen one paper reference anything beyond one running variable [@papay_extending_2011]. Never seen a running variable that is score function.
    5.  **Fear 2**:  sample size here is small. RD performs better with large sample size.

### Part 2: DinD with matching {-}

Smaller analysis of the 3 stores that self-selected and were matched to 3 other stores.

3. **Method:** Difference in difference been years 2015 and 2016
    3. Power here will be small. Total N will be 6. Likely that nothing will be significant. But need to be transparent.
