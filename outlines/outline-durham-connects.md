# Paper 3 --- Durham Connects as an Information Treatment

> **Question:** For families that participated in the Durham Connects pilot program, did the information and nurse contact impact the probability of applying for social services?

> **Hypothesis**: I expect to observed a larger proportion of families that participated in Durham Connects requesting social services. My hypothesis is that the information and nurse contact provided to DC families decreased the complexity of applying and navigating the social safety net. As a result, DC families are observed more frequently not because they are, on average, in greater need of assistance, but because they have been informed and encouraged to seek out available resources.

## Introduction

**Part 1**: It can be difficult to navigate the application process when requesting government assistance. Information about programs and their eligibility requirements is diffuse and the requirements can be confusing. [TK survey data about application rates, process]

The shadow price equals the search costs and transaction cost of obtaining assistance. As a result, the "price" of assistance varies from eligible consumer to consumer, as does the net benefit (assistance minus costs). 

Reframe the demand and supply of social services as a exclusive marketplace where a single good---assistance---is "purchased". Only those eligible for assistance may "purchase" assistance and the "merchant" (i.e. social services office) determines eligibility and the amount of assistance. Any "consumer" (i.e. families and/or individuals) may request assistance (demand) but consumers may only "purchase" assistance if eligible. The price of assistance, however, is not free. There is a shadow price. 

Furthermore, informational asymmetry restricts the amount of consumers participating in the market. The merchant knows or can quickly determine who is eligible to "purchase" assistance but otherwise eligible consumers in need of assistance may be unaware of their status or that the marketplace exists. Marketplace participation is therefore a function consumer's information level, demand for assistance, the costs of obtaining assistance, and the net benefit of receiving assistance. Together, this implies that consumer participation could be increased by providing more information and by lowering search and transaction costs.




**Part 2**: The Durham Connects pilot program provides an opportunity to test whether demand for social services increases after reducing search costs and transaction costs, and increasing information about existing programs and eligibility.

**Part 3**: New mothers are generally open to help and support soon after giving birth.

**Part 4**: Families and mothers consider nurses to be trustworthy sources of information.

**Part 5**: Durham Connects pilot provided a point of contact with Durham Social Services. A similar point of contact was not provided to the control group.
