<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>SNAP participants, compared to higher income groups, tend to purchase more unhealthy foods and fewer fruits and vegetables. This is known as the “Nutrition Gap”. These individual choices, in aggregate, produces a negative externality: poor diet—one consisting of processed foods and other products high in sugar, salts, and fats—is closely linked to adverse health outcomes e.g. obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. But the health care costs of these diet-related conditions are not paid for by SNAP participants but by taxpayers. Policymakers, therefore, should be looking for cost-effective was to incentivize SNAP participants towards making healthier food choices.</p>
<p><strong>Question(s)</strong></p>
<p>How effective would a targeted subsidy aimed be at reducing the nutrition gap? Specifically, could a subsidy aimed at increasing the fruit and vegetables purchases of SNAP participants make a significant impact on overall diet? And would the costs of the subsidy justify the health care savings—assuming there are any?</p>
<p><strong>Case Study</strong></p>
<p>A recently successful fruit and vegetable subsidy program for SNAP participants has been the <a href="http://www.doubleupfoodbucks.org/"><strong>Double Up Food Bucks</strong></a> program. The program initially began as way to encourage more SNAP participants to visits local farmer’s markets. DUFB grew dramatically across Michigan farmer’s market from 2009 to 2014. To make the DUFB more accessible, the USDA provided funding via that 2014 Farm Bill for the program to be piloted in grocery stores. Four months of point-of-sale data have collected but <strong>a rigorous analysis of the point-of-sale data has yet to be completed</strong>.</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—know as “Food Stamps” before to 2008—was created to help mitigate food insecurity in the US. The intention of policymakers was to ensure a basic, minimal level of food security for low-income families <span class="citation">(USDA FNS <a href="references.html#ref-usda_fns_short_2014">2014</a>)</span>. Other than obvious vices, like alcohol and cigarettes, there are no restrictions on what food items (excluding pet food) can be purchased with SNAP. Consumer are free to purchase unhealthy and/or healthy food. But in the last few years, these light restrictions on what can and cannot be purchases with SNAP have fallen under scrutiny.</p>
<div id="purchasing-patterns-of-snap-beneficiaries" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Purchasing Patterns of SNAP Beneficiaries</h3>
<p>Research has found that SNAP participants, at best, consume same amount of unhealthy foods (e.g. sugar-sweetened beverages, baked goods, snacks, candy) compared to non-participants and ineligible households <span class="citation">(Todd and Ploeg <a href="references.html#ref-todd_caloric_2014">2014</a>; Hoynes, McGranahan, and Schanzenbach <a href="references.html#ref-hoynes_snap_2014">2014</a>)</span>. This is not a positive results. The average US household, regardless of income, fails to meet the USDA’s dietary guidelines <span class="citation">(USDA <a href="references.html#ref-usda_scientific_2015">2015</a>)</span>. Most US households purchase and consume far too much meat and foods rich in sugars and fats, and far too few fruits, vegetables and whole grains <span class="citation">(Frazão <a href="references.html#ref-frazao_americas_1999">1999</a>)</span>. Far more research has found that SNAP participants are significantly <em>less</em> likely to meet USDA dietary guidelines than the average US household and much <em>more</em> likely to consume unhealthy foods <span class="citation">(Andreyeva, Tripp, and Schwartz <a href="references.html#ref-andreyeva_dietary_2015">2015</a>; Leung et al. <a href="references.html#ref-leung_dietary_2012">2012</a>; Nguyen and Powell <a href="references.html#ref-nguyen_supplemental_2015">2015</a>; Wolfson and Bleich <a href="references.html#ref-wolfson_fruit_2015">2015</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="poor-diet-and-metabolic-risk-factors" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Poor Diet and Metabolic Risk Factors</h3>
<p>Frequent and continuous consumption of unhealthy foods—as is captured by “unhealthy” part of “unhealthy foods”—is worrisome to health experts and policy makers. There is a direct and well-established link between poor diet, metabolic risk factors (e.g. obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, raised blood lipids), and cardiovascular disease and strokes. Metabolic risk factors (MRFs) lead to deaths that are considered “avoidable” by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <span class="citation">(WHO <a href="references.html#ref-who_global_2014">2014</a>; CDC <a href="references.html#ref-cdc_vital_2013">2013</a>)</span>. Governments and individuals, therefore, have a role in reducing the incidence rates of MRFs because both can help reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods and increase the consumption ones. The US, in particular, given it has the highest per capita health care costs in the world, could greatly benefit economically from policy interventions aimed at promoting better diet quality and reducing the rate (and cost) of MRFs.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> The Economic Costs of Diet-Related Chronic Diseases</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain cancers can be considered “diet-related” chronic diseases if the person suffering from the disease exhibits any of the MRFs and consumes an unhealthy diet. While it is possible to eat well and still suffer from a heart attack or a stroke, the likelihood is relatively low compared to a counter-factual self that eats poorly. On the other hand, it is a well established that a poor diet greatly increases the risk of any of the MRFs, which in turn greatly increases the risk of chronic diseases <span class="citation">(Burke GL et al. <a href="references.html#ref-burke_gl_impact_2008">2008</a>)</span>.</p>

</div>
<div id="adjustments-to-snap" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Adjustments to SNAP</h3>
<p>There is mixed evidence about whether participating in SNAP leads to increases in MRFs, particularly obesity. A review of the literature and empirics by <span class="citation">Meyerhoefer and Yang (<a href="references.html#ref-meyerhoefer_relationship_2011">2011</a>)</span> highlights how poor methodology has yielded a confusing landscape of results. But while no definitive link between SNAP participation and poor health has not been made, it is still a fact that the average American—SNAP participant or not—has a poor diet.</p>
<p>There has been enough evidence of SNAP participants using their benefits to purchase unhealthy foods that some policy makers have asked why restrictions on some food items (e.g. sugar-sweetened beverages) have yet to be imposed <span class="citation">(Barnhill <a href="references.html#ref-barnhill_impact_2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>[<strong>MORE INFO ON SNAP RESTRICTIONS</strong>]</p>
<p>Within the context of US obesity epidemic, alarmingly high rates of MRFs, and accelerating government health care cost, some policy makers have suggested making SNAP more like the Woman, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The WIC program provides food vouchers which limit participants to a select group of products. These products are specifically selected to be healthy to ensure women and their children receive nutritious, healthy foods. This is in contrast to SNAP, where there are few restrictions and participants are free to purchase cookies, chips, soda, and any other assortment of process foods that have no WIC voucher equivalent.</p>
<p>The purchase of unhealthy foods by SNAP participants is considered problematic because SNAP participants also tend to receive some form of government subsidized health care (e.g. Medicaid). The government is therefore providing a benefit transfer to individuals who generally tend to spend those benefits on a largely unhealthy diets, which are closely linked to higher morbidity rates. But the financial cost of treating MRFs are not borne by the participants of government subsidized health care. The government is therefore helping fund, and then pay for, a negative externality produced by the individual consumption choices of most SNAP participants. Ideally, given the strong link between diet and morbidity, the government would prefer SNAP participants make, on the whole, healthier food choices when using SNAP benefits <span class="citation">(Richards and Sindelar <a href="references.html#ref-richards_rewarding_2013">2013</a>; Brownell KD and Ludwig DS <a href="references.html#ref-brownell_kd_supplemental_2011">2011</a>; Guthrie et al. <a href="references.html#ref-guthrie_usda_2007">2007</a>)</span>. It would lower health care costs and save the government money.</p>
<p>These unhealthy food choices, some have argued, are a function of limited <em>budget constraints</em> <span class="citation">(Andreyeva, Long, and Brownell <a href="references.html#ref-andreyeva_impact_2010">2010</a>)</span>. That is, folks purchase unhealthy foods because they are cheaper, per calorie, then healthy foods, and make it easier to satisfy food requirements given a limited budget. Therefore, while not optimal for health, it is optimal/rational given a small food budget. But SNAP participants, like any and all other consumers, do not entirely optimizing on price. All consumers optimize across many dimensions (e.g. habit, taste, price, convenience etc). It is not entirely clear that if SNAP participants did receive more money that they would necessarily eat better <span class="citation">(An <a href="references.html#ref-an_effectiveness_2013">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>If SNAP participants desire fruits and vegetables but they lie beyond their limited means, then increasing their purchasing power <em>overall</em> would be sufficient to make fruits and vegetables more accessible. This would imply that the most “straightforward” solution—if one ignores the political challenges—would be to increase benefit transfers to SNAP participants. This of course is not what happens when low-income households receive marginal boosts of income; a dislike for fruits and vegetables is endemic across all income groups in the United States <span class="citation">(Frazão <a href="references.html#ref-frazao_americas_1999">1999</a>)</span>. While proclivity to purchase for fruits and veggies does rise with income and education, the increases are not dramatic. SNAP participants, when they to receive a marginal increase in SNAP benefits, do not suddenly begin purchasing more fruits and vegetables <span class="citation">(Hayden, Blisard, and Jolliffe <a href="references.html#ref-hayden_income_2003">2003</a>)</span>. Concern for eating healthy is a luxury; it becomes a priority only after incomes rise enough to alleviate more pressing concerns—like hunger or buying enough food to last until the next benefit transfer.</p>

<li>As a Society
<ul>
<li>There are societal costs (externalities) to having SNAP participants eat unhealthy foods.
<ul>
<li>Increases the costs of Medicaid and Medicare (more heart disease, type 2 diabetes)</li>
<li>Reduces productivity (poor diet, poor health results in worse labor market participation)</li>

<li>Complicated with very little (<em>%6</em>) of the overall costs going to the actual subsidy.</li>
<li>Evidence that the program was not well understood by participants.</li>
<li>Results were an small increase in serving size of fruits/vegetables per month

<li>Problems
<ul>
<li>Survey-based data</li>
<li>POS data did exists but did not seem to be used.</li>
<li>No real understanding of how other purchases were affected (did households substitute healthy for unhealthy or just purchase more food overall?)</li>

<li>Double Up Food Bucks
<ul>
<li>Program started by the Fair Food Network in 2009 to increase accessibility of Farmer’s Markets to low-income communities in Detroit, MI area.
<ul>
<li>Provided a dollar-for-dollar match of SNAP benefits (capped at $20)</li>
<li>Participants received a token that could then be used on any locally grown (MI) produce.</li>
