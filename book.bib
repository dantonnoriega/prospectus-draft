  abstract = {Despite a lack of consistent diagnostic criteria, the metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasingly evident in children and adolescents, portending a tsunami of chronic disease and mortality as this generation ages. The diagnostic criteria for MetS apply absolute cutoffs to continuous variables and fail to take into account aging, pubertal changes, and race/ethnicity. We attempt to define MetS mechanistically to determine its specific etiologies and to identify targets for therapy. Whereas the majority of studies document a relationship of visceral fat to insulin resistance, ectopic liver fat correlates better with dysfunctional insulin dynamics from which the rest of MetS derives. In contrast to the systemic metabolism of glucose, the liver is the primary metabolic clearinghouse for 4 specific foodstuffs that have been associated with the development of MetS: trans-fats, branched-chain amino acids, ethanol, and fructose. These 4 substrates (1) are not insulin regulated and (2) deliver metabolic intermediates to hepatic mitochondria without an appropriate {\textquotedblleft}pop-off{\textquotedblright} mechanism for excess substrate, enhancing lipogenesis and ectopic adipose storage. Excessive fatty acid derivatives interfere with hepatic insulin signal transduction. Reactive oxygen species accumulate, which cannot be quenched by adjacent peroxisomes; these reactive oxygen species reach the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a compensatory process termed the {\textquotedblleft}unfolded protein response,{\textquotedblright} driving further insulin resistance and eventually insulin deficiency. No obvious drug target exists in this pathway; thus, the only rational therapeutic approaches remain (1) altering hepatic substrate availability (dietary modification), (2) reducing hepatic substrate flux (high fiber), or (3) increasing mitochondrial efficiency (exercise).},

  abstract = {Summary
Evidence suggests that excessive intake of added sugars has adverse effects on cardiometabolic health, which is consistent with many reviews and consensus reports from WHO and other unbiased sources. 74\% of products in the US food supply contain caloric or low-calorie sweeteners, or both. Of all packaged foods and beverages purchased by a nationally representative sample of US households in 2013, 68\% (by proportion of calories) contain caloric sweeteners and 2\% contain low-calorie sweeteners. We believe that in the absence of intervention, the rest of the world will move towards this pervasiveness of added sugars in the food supply. Our analysis of trends in sales of sugar-sweetened beverages around the world, in terms of calories sold per person per day and volume sold per person per day, shows that the four regions with the highest consumption are North America, Latin America, Australasia, and western Europe. The fastest absolute growth in sales of sugar-sweetened beverages by country in 2009{\textendash}14 was seen in Chile. We believe that action is needed to tackle the high levels and continuing growth in sales of such beverages worldwide. Many governments have initiated actions to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in the past few years, including taxation (eg, in Mexico); reduction of their availability in schools; restrictions on marketing of sugary foods to children; public awareness campaigns; and positive and negative front-of-pack labelling. In our opinion, evidence of the effectiveness of these actions shows that they are moving in the right direction, but governments should view them as a learning process and improve their design over time. A key challenge for policy makers and researchers is the absence of a consensus on the relation of beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners and fruit juices with cardiometabolic outcomes, since decisions about whether these are healthy substitutes for sugar-sweetened beverages are an integral part of policy design.},

  abstract = {Background: Tobacco industry funding was instrumental in creating and financing the Consumer Tax Alliance in 1989 as an organisation that relied upon extensive media outreach to build opposition to excise taxes as a regressive form of taxation. By obscuring its own role in this effort, the tobacco industry undermined the public's reasonable expectations for transparency in the policy-making process.
Aim: To examine the formation and activities of the Consumer Tax Alliance as a {\textquotedblleft}hybrid{\textquotedblright} form of interest group in order to provide tobacco control and public health advocates with a better understanding of unanticipated tobacco industry coalitions and facilitate appropriate countermeasures.
Methods: Document searches through the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and through Tobacco Documents Online and review of background literature.
Results: The Tobacco Institute actively sought liberal allies beginning in the mid-1980s in seeking to build public opposition to cigarette excise tax increases by promoting them as a regressive form of taxation. The creation of the Consumer Tax Alliance in 1989 was expressly intended to turn labour and middle-class opinion against prospective excise tax increases in federal budget deficit negotiations, without divulging the tobacco industry's role in its formation.
Conclusion: It is important to understand the dynamic by which trusted organisations can be induced to alter their agendas in response to funding sources. Advocates need to understand this form of interest group behaviour so that they are better able to negotiate the policy arena by diagnosing and exposing this influence where it occurs and, by doing so, be better prepared to take appropriate countermeasures.},

  abstract = {Background: Although the intake of high-fat and high-sugar food activates mesolimbic reward, gustatory, and oral somatosensory brain regions, contributing to overeating, few studies have examined the relative role of fat and sugar in the activation of these brain regions, which would inform policy, prevention, and treatment interventions designed to reduce obesity.
Objective: We evaluated the effect of a high-fat or high-sugar equicaloric chocolate milkshake and increasing fat or sugar milkshake content on the activation of these regions.
Design: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the neural response to the intake of high-fat/high-sugar, high-fat/low-sugar, low-fat/high-sugar, and low-fat/low-sugar chocolate milkshakes and a tasteless solution in 106 lean adolescents (mean \ensuremath{\pm} SD age = 15.00 \ensuremath{\pm} 0.88 y). Analyses contrasted the activation to the various milkshakes.
Results: High-fat compared with high-sugar equicaloric milkshakes caused greater activation in the bilateral caudate, postcentral gyrus, hippocampus, and inferior frontal gyrus. High-sugar compared with high-fat equicaloric milkshakes caused greater activation in the bilateral insula extending into the putamen, the Rolandic operculum, and thalamus, which produced large activation regions. Increasing sugar in low-fat milkshakes caused greater activation in the bilateral insula and Rolandic operculum; increasing fat content did not elicit greater activation in any region.
Conclusions: Fat caused greater activation of the caudate and oral somatosensory regions than did sugar, sugar caused greater activation in the putamen and gustatory regions than did fat, increasing sugar caused greater activity in gustatory regions, and increasing fat did not affect the activation. Results imply that sugar more effectively recruits reward and gustatory regions, suggesting that policy, prevention, and treatment interventions should prioritize reductions in sugar intake.

  abstract = {Context
American obesity rates continue to escalate, but an effective policy response remains elusive. Specific changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have been proposed as one way to improve nutrition and combat obesity among lower-income populations. While current SNAP proposals hold promise, some important challenges still remain.

Methods
We discuss the four most common recommendations for changes to SNAP and their benefits and limitations. We then propose three new delivery options for SNAP that take advantage of behavioral economic insights and encourage the selection of healthy foods.

Findings
Although the existing proposals could help SNAP recipients, they often do not address some important behavioral impediments to buying healthy foods. We believe that behavioral economics can be used to design alternative policies with several advantages, although we recognize and discuss some of their limitations. The first proposal rewards healthy purchases with more SNAP funds and provides an additional incentive to maintain healthier shopping patterns. The second proposal uses the opportunity to win prizes to reward healthy food choices, and the prizes further support healthier habits. The final proposal simplifies healthy food purchases by allowing individuals to commit their SNAP benefits to more nutritious selections in advance.

Conclusions
Reforming the delivery structure of SNAP's benefits could help improve nutrition, weight, and overall health of lower-income individuals. We advocate for more and diverse SNAP proposals, which should be tested and, possibly, combined. Their implementation, however, would require political will, administrative capacity, and funding.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the response by overweight individuals, counselled in a work environment, to energy-reduced diets in which the amount of sucrose-containing foods is varied.
DESIGN: Two energy-reduced diets were designed as a weight-reducing programme. A low-sugar diet (LSD) providing 5\% of its energy from sucrose and a sugar-containing diet (SCD) providing 10\% of its energy from sucrose incorporated as sweet foods were devised. Both diets were constructed to contain about 33\% of the energy from fat. The diets, designed to provide a deficit of 2.51 MJ/day (600 kcal/day) per individual, were randomly allocated to subjects in an 8 week parallel design study.
SUBJECTS: Ninety-five subjects were recruited from a large service industry if they were more than 7 kg (1 stone) in weight above body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m(2). Sixty-eight subjects completed the programme.
MEASUREMENTS: Fortnightly body weight measurements were taken using calibrated scales; BMI at baseline and week 8; and nutrient intake using 2 day food record diaries at baseline and weeks 2, 4 and 8.
RESULTS: Weight loss over the 8 weeks was 2.2 kg (LSD) and 3.0 kg (SCD). BMI changed from 29.2 on the LSD and 30.1 kg/m(2) SCD at baseline to 28.2 and 28.8 kg/m(2) at week 8 respectively. The actual prescribed commercially added sucrose intakes were 5\% energy (LSD) or 10\% energy (SCD). Reported percentage energy from fat was significantly lower on the SCD (and would seem to support the theory of an inverse relationship between fat and sugar) than on the LSD, where there was seen to be no significant reduction. There was no evidence of micronutrient dilution that could be directly attributed to the sucrose content of the diets.
CONCLUSION: These results provide no justification for the exclusion of added sucrose in weight-reducing diets.},

We first estimate demand models which do not restrict unduly the pattern of consumer preferences as does much previous research in the area of differenciated products. Using recently available transactions data we estimate own and cross price elasticities in a relatively unrestricted manner. We next turn to competitive analysis using our estimated demand system. We consider two applications in this paper. The main economic factor that we consider is that the firms which produce the differentiated products almost always tend to be multi-product firms in the given industry. Our first application is competitive analysis when two firms are allowed to merge. The other application that we consider is inference on the competitive structure in an industry. In both applications we consider the effect of a multi-product firm where its competitive decisions for one brand affects it sales and prices for other brands that it produces. /// La diff{\'e}renciation des produits est un aspect {\'e}conomique central de la concurrence sur les march{\'e}s des biens de consommations comme les c{\'e}r{\'e}ales, les sodas ou les bi{\`e}res.

  abstract = {Background~
In light of the current obesity epidemic, treatment models are needed that can prevent weight gain or provide weight loss. We examined the long-term effects of a supervised program of moderate-intensity exercise on body weight and composition in previously sedentary, overweight and moderately obese men and women. We hypothesized that a 16-month program of verified exercise would prevent weight gain or provide weight loss in the exercise group compared with controls.Methods
This was a randomized controlled efficacy trial. Participants were recruited from 2 midwestern universities and their surrounding communities. One hundred thirty-one participants were randomized to exercise or control groups, and 74 completed the intervention and all laboratory testing. Exercise was supervised, and the level of energy expenditure of exercise was measured. Controls remained sedentary. All participants maintained ad libitum diets.Results
Exercise prevented weight gain in women and produced weight loss in men. Men in the exercise group had significant mean \ensuremath{\pm} SD decreases in weight (5.2 \ensuremath{\pm} 4.7 kg), body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) (1.6 \ensuremath{\pm} 1.4), and fat mass (4.9 \ensuremath{\pm} 4.4 kg) compared with controls. Women in the exercise group maintained baseline weight, body mass index, and fat mass, and controls showed significant mean \ensuremath{\pm} SD increases in body mass index (1.1 \ensuremath{\pm} 2.0), weight (2.9 \ensuremath{\pm} 5.5 kg), and fat mass (2.1 \ensuremath{\pm} 4.8 kg) at 16 months. No significant changes occurred in fat-free mass in either men or women; however, both had significantly reduced visceral fat.Conclusions
Moderate-intensity exercise sustained for 16 months is effective for weight management in young adults.},

In addition to substitutions that may arise with other beverages, we account for substitutions between SSBs and 12 major food categories. Our main findings are that the tax would result in a decrease in store-bought energy of 24.3 kcal per day per person, which would translate into an average weight loss of 1.6 pounds during the first year and a cumulated weight loss of 2.9 pounds in the long run. We do not find evidence of substitution to sugary foods and show that complementary foods could contribute to decreasing energy purchases. Despite their significantly lower price elasticity, the tax has a similar effect on calories for the largest purchasers of SSBs.},

These insights fall into the following categories: the influence of starting points (status quo bias and anchoring effects); communicating health information (simplicity and framing); and unintended consequences of policy interventions (compensation, substitution, and the peanuts effect). The paper discusses opportunities for improving the design of food policies and interventions by altering default options, providing the public with simple and meaningful nutrition information, carefully constructing the framing of public health messages, and designing food policies to minimize unintended consequences, such as compensation and substitution.},

  abstract = {This paper reconsiders the welfare effects of a transfer payment in a two-commodity world with two agents (countries), by taking the presence of exogenous and endogenous distortions into account. When there is an exogenous tax-cumsubsidy on production, consumption, or trade, the analysis demonstrates that a transfer may paradoxically enrich the donor and immiserize the recipient under certain specific conditions. These welfare paradoxes are also shown to be possible if the transfer endogenously induces "directly unproductive profit-seeking" activity of lobbyists. Concluding remarks emphasize the paper's relevance for policy-makers.},

  abstract = {The debate about behavioral economics {\textendash} the incorporation of insights from psychology into economics {\textendash} is often framed as a question about the foundational assumptions of economic models. This paper presents a more pragmatic perspective on behavioral economics that focuses on its value for improving empirical predictions and policy decisions. I discuss three ways in which behavioral economics can contribute to public policy: by offering new policy tools, improving predictions about the effects of existing policies, and generating new welfare implications. I illustrate these contributions using applications to retirement savings, labor supply, and neighborhood choice. Behavioral models provide new tools to change behaviors such as savings rates and new counterfactuals to estimate the effects of policies such as income taxation. Behavioral models also provide new prescriptions for optimal policy that can be characterized in a non-paternalistic manner using methods analogous to those in neoclassical models. Model uncertainty does not justify using the neoclassical model; instead, it can provide a new rationale for using behavioral nudges. I conclude that incorporating behavioral features to the extent they help answer core economic questions may be more productive than viewing behavioral economics as a separate subfield that challenges the assumptions of neoclassical models.},

Using pooled cross section-time series data on state and Federal alcohol taxes and beverage prices, beer taxes are found to be poor predictors of alcohol prices. Controlling for state and period effects, excise taxes appear to be over-shifted: Retail prices rise by more than the amount of the tax, and the rise occurs within 3 months.},

Evidence shows that SNAP benefits help alleviate poverty and food insecurity among participating households. However, like most Americans, the dietary patterns of participating households show room for improvement, with adult participants typically underconsuming fruits, whole grains, and other healthy foods while consuming too many empty calories. Findings from behavioral economics pilot studies suggest that the manner in which food choices are presented can influence consumers' decisions. These insights may help design more effective strategies to encourage SNAP shoppers to make more healthful food choices. SNAP participants are less likely to have heard of the Dietary Guidelines, the Food Pyramid, or MyPyramid (now represented by MyPlate) than higher income individuals.},

To improve, health care systems need mechanisms and incentives for continually gathering, assessing, and acting on data.

Restructured economic incentives can encourage clinicians to increase value (higher quality and/or lower cost) for their patients. While necessary, incentives are not sufficient{\textemdash}information is also needed. Incentives can lead clinicians to demand better information. Much of the necessary data is already used in patient care and billing; some additional variables will come directly from patients. The notion builds on two concepts: collective intelligence and positive deviance. The former characterizes knowledge gained from observing the behavior of many independent actors adapting to changing situations. Positive deviants are those who achieve far better results than expected. By rewarding positive deviants, rather than trying to identify and {\textquotedblleft}correct{\textquotedblright} those who are problematic, providers will voluntarily identify themselves and their methods for achieving superior outcomes.},

While it is well known these estimators share an asymptotic distribution, the GEL estimators may perform better in finite sample, particularly in the case of many weak instruments. A relatively new literature has documented that finite-sample bias in the demand estimation problem of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) is often large, especially in the absence of exogenous cost shifting instruments. This paper provides a formulation for a computationally tractable GEL estimator based on the MPEC method of Su and Judd (2012) and adapts it to the BLP problem. When compared to GMM, the GEL estimator performs substantially better, reducing the bias by as much as 90\%. Furthermore, it is possible to use analytic bias correction to reduce the bias even more and obtain accurate estimates with relatively small numbers of markets.},

  abstract = {We measure the causal effects of income and wealth on the demand for private-label products. Prior research suggests that these effects are large and, in particular, that private-label demand rises during recessions. Our empirical analysis is based on a comprehensive household-level transactions database matched with price information from store-level scanner data and wealth data based on local house value indices. The Great Recession provides a key source of the variation in our data, with a large and geographically diverse impact on household incomes over time. We estimate income and wealth effects using "within" variation of income and wealth at the household level. Our estimates can be interpreted as income and wealth effects consistent with a consumer demand model based on utility maximization. We establish a precisely measured negative effect of income on private-label shares. The effect of wealth is negative but not precisely measured. However, the estimated effect sizes are small, in contrast with prior academic work and industry views. An examination of the possible supply-side response to the recession shows only small changes in the relative price of national-brand and private-label products. Our estimates also reveal a large positive trend in private-label shares that predates the Great Recession. We examine some possible factors underlying this trend, but find no evidence that this trend is systematically related to specific private-label quality tiers or to the overall rate of private-label versus national-brand product introductions.},

Of course, in practice, the process by which policies are adopted does not resemble the planner's problem in social choice theory. In addition, real fiscal policies do not look much like the recommendations that arise from the optimal tax literature. Governments operate in public choice environments that are not conducive to focused remedying of market failure, and they suffer from their own tendencies to fail to achieve their objectives. Nevertheless, many of the tools are in place to help the federal and state governments focus tax and spending in ways that can maximize public value.},

However, meat products across species are likely stronger substitutes than some products from the same species. Further, demand for specific meat products would be expected to respond differently to market information about food safety or other events. This study uses monthly consumer panel data collected between 1992 and 2000 to estimate a disaggregated meat product demand system. The use of the expectations maximization algorithm is introduced to estimate a demand system that adjusts for the econometric problem of censored data resulting from purchased shares of some products by individuals often being equal to zero. Results indicate that certain individual meat products have noticeably different own-price elasticities than existing aggregate meat product estimates of their respective species. Some individual meat products have stronger substitutes across species than within species (e.g., beef steak and pork chops are substitutes, but beef roast and ground beef or not substitutes for steak).},

We argue for grounding this analysis in a continuous-time stochastic model. This permits the data to be fully utilized; it also allows a unified treatment of the various outcomes analyzed in the many approaches that use only part of the information contained in such data. We focus on the familiar continuos-time Markov model, summarize its properties, report its implications for various outcomes, describe extensions to deal with population heterogeneity and time dependence, and outline a maximum-likelihood procedure for estimating the extended model from event-history data. The discussion in illustrated with an empirical analysis of the effects of an income-maintenance experiment on change in marital status. We conclude by contrasting event-history analysis with cross-sectional analysis, event-count analysis, and panel analysis. We find that event-history analysis has substantial advantages over the other approaches.},

If assignment to the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, independent of the potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple treatment-control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score, leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information about the propensity score.},

To answer this question, this study was conducted to provide an empirical analysis of grocery store access and prices across inner city and suburban communities within the Minneapolis and St. Paul metropolitan area. The comparison among different types of grocers and geographic areas is drawn from a survey of approximately fifty grocery items for fifty-five stores. Results indicate that the poor pay only slightly more in the Twin Cities grocery market. More significantly, those who shop in non-chain stores pay a significant premium, and the poor have less access to chain stores. This study reveals that the biggest factor contributing to higher grocery costs in poor neighborhoods is that large chain stores, where prices tend to be lower, are not located in these neighborhoods.},

Soft drink consumption has also expanded rapidly, so much so that soft drinks are currently the largest single contributors to energy intake. In this paper, we investigate the potential for soft drink taxes to combat rising levels of child and adolescent obesity through a reduction in consumption. Our results, based on state soft drink sales and excise tax information between 1989 and 2006 and the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey, suggest that soft drink taxation, as currently practiced in the United States, leads to a moderate reduction in soft drink consumption by children and adolescents. However, we show that this reduction in soda consumption is completely offset by increases in consumption of other high-calorie drinks.},

In the first step, the unknown coefficients of the "selection" equation are consistently estimated. The estimates are then used to estimate the regression equation of interest. The estimator proposed in this paper is consistent and asymptotically normal, with a rate of convergence that can be made arbitrarily close to n\textsuperscript{-1/2}, depending on the strength of certain smoothness assumptions. The finite sample properties of the estimator are investigated in a small Monte Carlo simulation.},

Tax incidences basic lesson that the real and nominal tax burdens are not necessarily related means that taxes on capital are born by workers, that investment incentives are injurious to capitalists, that taxation of foreigners simply represent indirect domestic taxation, and that generations alive many decades in the future may be supporting those currently alive. The study of tax incidence is both fun, because it offers such surprising findings, and very important, because of its implications about the impacts of government policies. Much of the current tax incidence literature considers the settings of certainty, perfect information, and market clearing. As more sophisticated models relax these assumptions, the theory of tax incidence is enriched and, with all probability, provides even more surprising and exciting economic insights.},

Using novel data from New York surveys that asked directly about cigarette prices and purchases from reservations, we focus on two under-studied but basic empirical economic questions this raises. First, what is the economic incidence of the tax break? In data from New York over a period when the state did not attempt to collect taxes on reservation purchases, our estimates suggest that the tax break is usually fully shifted to the consumer. The notable exception is on one reservation where a tribal monopoly captures almost half of the tax break. Second, has the tax break increased consumer demand for low-quality cigarettes relative to high-quality cigarettes? New York's cigarette tax is a fixed amount per pack, providing an opportunity to test the Alchian and Allen substitution theorem. We find some support for the prediction that the tax break increases consumer demand for lower-quality cigarettes.},

The large obesity-related health burden negatively impacts many relevant health outcomes (e.g. quality of life, disability, mortality) and leads to increased healthcare utilization. This excess service use is the main driver behind high healthcare costs of obese individuals. Findings indicate that costs rise curvilinearly with increasing body mass index, especially among the obese. As more individuals of a country's population become obese, a larger share of total annual national healthcare expenditure is spent on obesity and obesity-related health problems. In addition to escalating healthcare costs, obesity goes along with indirect costs through decreases in workforce productivity. The empirical evidence has shown beyond doubt that obesity negatively impacts individuals, healthcare systems, employers, and the economy as a whole.

This paper reviews the literature on both sides of the empowerment-development nexus, and argues that the interrelationships are probably too weak to be self-sustaining, and that continuous policy commitment to equality for its own sake may be needed to bring about equality between men and women.},

  abstract = {Background
Family planning programmes in developing countries need a better understanding of nurse{\textendash}patient communication in order to improve the quality of counselling.
Objectives
To identify factors in the clinic and in the community that enable nurses and patients to communicate effectively with one another.
Design
The study explored the personal experiences of nurses and patients who communicate especially effectively during family planning consultations (so-called {\textquotedblleft}positive deviants{\textquotedblright}).
Setting
Sixty-four randomly selected public clinics located in East Java, Indonesia.
Participants
Seven positive deviant nurses and 32 positive deviant patients were identified from among 64 nurses and 768 patients who participated in an earlier patient coaching study. Flooding prevented 5 patients from participating in the study, reducing their number to 27.
Methods
Investigators conducted: (1) a content analysis of qualitative data collected by structured in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions (FGDs) with positive deviant nurses and patients, and (2) analyses of variance (ANOVA) of quantitative data on clinic, nurse, and patient characteristics.
Results
Positive deviant nurses identified four factors, listed in rough order of importance, that helped them communicate effectively: independent study to strengthen their knowledge and skills; communication aids; feedback from colleagues; and motivation stemming from a desire to help people, patients' appreciation, husband's support, and increased income. Positive deviant patients identified five enabling factors: motivation due to their need for a service; confidence in their own communication skills; positive feedback from nurses; belief in patients' right and responsibility to communicate with nurses; and communication aids.
Conclusions
Insights from positive deviant nurses and patients suggest that efforts to improve nurse{\textendash}patient communication should go beyond conventional communication skills training. Managers should consider a mix of clinic-based interventions (such as peer feedback, communication aids, and better management of patient flow) and community-based interventions (such as patient education and mass media).},

Given the reality of present-biased preferences, if convenience was associated with healthier foods and less healthy foods were less convenient, people would likely consume healthier foods. This study examines the application of this principle in a school lunchroom where healthier foods were made more convenient relative to less healthy foods.
Methods One of two lunch lines in a cafeteria was arranged so as to display only healthier foods and flavored milk. Trained field researchers collected purchase and consumption data before and after the conversion. Mean comparisons were used to identify differences in selection and consumption of healthier foods, less healthy foods and chocolate milk.
Results Sales of healthier foods increased by 18\% and grams of less healthy foods consumed decreased by nearly 28\%. Also, healthier foods' share of total consumption increased from 33 to 36\%. Lastly, we find that students increased their consumption of flavored milk, but flavored milk's share of total consumption did not increase.
Conclusions In a school lunchroom, a convenience line that offered only healthier food options nudged students to consume fewer unhealthy foods. This result has key implications for encouraging healthy behavior in public schools nation wide, cafeterias and other food establishments.},

Because obesity has been equated with addiction, and because of their evolutionary commonalities, we chose to examine the metabolic, hedonic, and societal similarities between fructose and its fermentation byproduct ethanol. Elucidation of fructose metabolism in liver and fructose action in brain demonstrate three parallelisms with ethanol. First, hepatic fructose metabolism is similar to ethanol, as they both serve as substrates for de novo lipogenesis, and in the process both promote hepatic insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis. Second, fructosylation of proteins with resultant superoxide formation can result in hepatic inflammation similar to acetaldehyde, an intermediary metabolite of ethanol. Lastly, by stimulating the {\textquotedblleft}hedonic pathway{\textquotedblright} of the brain both directly and indirectly, fructose creates habituation, and possibly dependence; also paralleling ethanol. Thus, fructose induces alterations in both hepatic metabolism and central nervous system energy signaling, leading to a {\textquotedblleft}vicious cycle{\textquotedblright} of excessive consumption and disease consistent with metabolic syndrome. On a societal level, the treatment of fructose as a commodity exhibits market similarities to ethanol. Analogous to ethanol, societal efforts to reduce fructose consumption will likely be necessary to combat the obesity epidemic.},

  title = {Weight change in relation to intake of sugar and sweet foods before and after weight reducing gastric surgery},
  volume = {20},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a diet containing many sweet foods is associated with poor weight loss after gastroplasty.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 375 severely obese subjects followed for 2 y after vertical banded gastroplasty or gastric banding; 34 subjects followed after gastric bypass.
RESULTS: Total energy and all macronutrients were reduced 2 y after surgery. Sweet foods were less reduced than other foods, resulting in a relative increase of sugar intake. At 2 y a high relative intake of sugar and fat was associated with a low energy intake and a large weight reduction in the gastroplasty group. In the highest quartile of mono+disaccharide intake (\ensuremath{>} 142 g) weight loss was 29.9 kg compared to 25.1 kg in lowest quartile (\ensuremath{>} 72 g). Absolute and relative sugar intake before surgery did not predict weight outcome. At 6 months, i.e. during a period of active weight reduction, energy intake was significantly related to weight loss.
CONCLUSION: Gastroplasty patients who continue selecting sweet foods appear to maintain lower energy intakes and lose more weight. However the associations are unlikely to be causal but probably indicative of changes in other aspects of the diet, eg exclusion of regular meals. Since large weight losses are most likely to be associated with low quality diets these results highlight the need for supplementation therapy of gastroplasty patients. Finally the lack of association between presurgical sugar intake and subsequent weight loss brings into question the surgical practice of selectively assigning sweet eaters to gastric bypass.},

Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.},

  abstract = {This study provides a multivariate analysis of the availability of food store outlets in the US and associations with neighborhood characteristics on race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES).
Commercial food store outlet data are linked across 28,050 zip codes to Census 2000 data. Multivariate regression analyses are used to examine associations between the availability of chain supermarkets, non-chain supermarkets, grocery stores and convenience stores and neighborhood characteristics on race, ethnicity and SES including additional controls for population size, urbanization and region.
Low-income neighborhoods have fewer chain supermarkets with only 75\% (p \ensuremath{<} 0.01) of that available in middle-income neighborhoods. Even after controlling for income and other covariates, the availability of chain supermarkets in African American neighborhoods is only 52\% (p \ensuremath{<} 0.01) of that in White neighborhoods with even less relative availability in urban areas. Hispanic neighborhoods have only 32\% (p \ensuremath{<} 0.01) as many chain supermarkets compared to non-Hispanic neighborhoods. Non-chain supermarkets and grocery stores are more prevalent in low-income and minority neighborhoods.
The study results highlight the importance of various potential public policy measures for improving access to supermarkets that may serve to reduce systematic local area barriers that are shown to exist by race, ethnicity and income.},

We use data from a large grocery retailer to match transactions that were recorded by the retailer (at the store) and by the Homescan panelist (at home). The matched data allow us to identify and document discrepancies between the two data sets in reported shopping trips, products, prices, and quantities. We find that the discrepancies are largest for the price variable, and show that they are due to two effects: the first seems like standard recording errors (by Nielsen or the panelists), while the second is likely due to the way Nielsen imputes prices. We present two simple applications to illustrate the impact of recording differences, and we use one of the applications to illustrate how the validation study can be used to adjust estimates obtained from Nielsen Homescan data. The results suggest that while recording discrepancies are clearly present and potentially impact results, corrections, like the one we employ, can be adopted by users of Homescan to investigate the robustness of their results to such potential recording differences.},

A significant contribution of our paper is that we compare two types of SSB taxes recently advocated by policy makers: A 20\% flat rate sales (valoric) tax and a 20\hspace{0.167em}cent/L volumetric tax. Censored demand is accounted for using a two-step procedure. We find that the volumetric tax would result in a greater per capita weight loss than the valoric tax (0.41\hspace{0.167em}kg vs. 0.29\hspace{0.167em}kg). The difference between the change in weight is substantial for the target group of heavy purchasers of SSBs in low-income households, with a weight reduction of up to 3.20\hspace{0.167em}kg for the volumetric and 2.06\hspace{0.167em}kg for the valoric tax. The average yearly per capita tax burden on low-income households is {\textdollar}17.87 (0.21\% of income) compared with {\textdollar}15.17 for high-income households (0.07\% of income) for the valoric tax, and {\textdollar}13.80 (0.15\%) and {\textdollar}10.10 (0.04\%) for the volumetric tax. Thus, the tax burden is lower, and weight reduction is higher under a volumetric tax. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Diet soda prices rose as well, suggesting that consumers may have substituted toward diet sodas after regular sodas became taxable. The prices of bottled water, pure (untaxed) juices, and milk were largely unchanged. A companion analysis of untaxed comparison products showed no general price increases around the time that the soda tax was imposed.},

This study utilizes information from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (1990-2007) to explore the relationship between the risk of unemployment and the consumption of various healthy and unhealthy foods. Estimates, based on fixed effects methodologies, indicate that a higher risk of unemployment is associated with reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables and increased consumption of {\textquotedblleft}unhealthy{\textquotedblright} foods such as snacks and fast food. In addition to estimation of the average population effect, heterogeneous responses are also identified through detailed sample stratifications and by isolating the effect for those predicted to be at highest risk of unemployment based on their socio-economic characteristics. Among individuals predicted to be at highest risk of being unemployed, a one percentage point increase in the resident state's unemployment rate is associated with a 2-8\% reduction in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. The impact is somewhat higher among married individuals and older adults. Supplementary analyses also explore specific mediating pathways, and point to reduced family income and adverse mental health as significant channels underlying the procyclical nature of healthy food consumption.},

We show that an economy in which agents have {\textquotedblleft}consumption commitments{\textquotedblright} is approximately equivalent to a habit formation model in which the habit stock is a weighted average of past consumption if idiosyncratic risk is large relative to aggregate risk. Consumption commitments can thus explain the empirical regularity that consumption is excessively sensitive and excessively smooth, findings that are typically attributed to habit formation. Unlike habit formation and other theories, but consistent with empirical evidence, the consumption commitments model also predicts that excess sensitivity and smoothness vanish for large shocks. These results suggest that behavior previously attributed to habit formation may be better explained by adjustment costs. We develop additional testable predictions to further distinguish the commitment and habit models and show that the two models have different welfare implications.},

The median confidence interval on ROI is over 100\% wide, the smallest exceeds 50\%. Detailed sales data show that, relative to the per capita cost of the advertising, individual-level sales are incredibly volatile; a coefficient of variation of 10 is common. Hence, informative advertising experiments can easily require more than ten million person-weeks, making experiments costly and potentially infeasible for many firms. Despite these unfavorable economics, randomized control trials represent progress by injecting new, unbiased information into the market. The statistically small impact of profitable advertising amid such noise means that selection bias is a crippling concern for widely-employed observational methods. We discuss how these biases and weak informational feedback from experiments fundamentally impact both advertisers and publishers.},

The data are on 23 large U.S. metro areas from 1979 to 2011. The article finds that demand shocks to local job growth have greater effects in increasing real wages if the local economy initially has low unemployment. However, demand shocks have greater effects in reducing unemployment, and increasing labor force participation, if the local economy initially has high unemployment, although these differences are only of modest statistical significance. The estimates are based on a new econometric approach to determining the correct dynamic structure for how local labor markets respond to demand shocks. This new approach finds that demand shocks have persistent effects on labor force participation and real wages, but not on unemployment, which contradicts some previous research.},

  abstract = {Introduction
The US Department of Agriculture has stocking criteria for healthy foods among Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP)-authorized retailers. Increased access to healthy food could improve diet quality among SNAP participants, which has implications for chronic disease prevention. The objective of this study was to quantify healthy foods stocked in small-size to mid-size retailers who are authorized under SNAP but not under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

Methods
We used formative, cross-sectional data from a large policy evaluation to conduct secondary analyses. Store audits were conducted in 2014 in 91 randomly selected, licensed food stores in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Supermarkets and retailers participating in WIC, which are required to stock healthy foods, were excluded as were other stores not reasonably expected to stock staple foods, such as specialty stores or produce stands. Availability of milk, fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain{\textendash}rich foods was assessed.

Results
The 91 stores studied were corner stores, food{\textendash}gas marts, dollar stores, and pharmacies. More than half carried 1 or more varieties of fat-free or low-fat milk, fresh or canned fruit, and whole-grain{\textendash}rich cereal. However, only one-third stocked 1 or more varieties of fresh vegetables and only one-quarter stocked whole-grain{\textendash}rich products, such as whole-grain-rich bread (26\%) or tortillas (21\%) or brown rice (25\%). Few stores stocked at least 2 varieties of each product.

Conclusions
Many stores did not stock a variety of healthy foods. The US Department of Agriculture should change policies to improve minimum stocking requirements for SNAP-authorized retailers.},

The literature, both theoretical and empirical, overall aims to explain the rising obesity trend and to identify the factors that contribute to obesity. Also surveyed are non-economic causes and consequences of obesity and the interconnection with economic influences. An understanding of the causes of obesity allows policies to be considered that might stem the global increase in obesity.},

However, misspecification of the consumer demand system can result in biased econometric results and misleading conclusions. We discuss some considerations that go into choosing a demand system specification and suggest that a `flexible functional form' be used. This approach avoids placing restrictions on the demand elasticities. We identify and discuss other issues that arise in the estimation of demand systems. We conclude with an empirical example concerning the calculation of lost profits damages in a patent infringement case. This example demonstrates how using a flexible functional form leads to a substantially more reliable damages calculation than using the particular restrictive functional form that is commonly used to calculate lost profits damages in patent litigation.},

We do so by constructing two alternative measures of consumption expenditure, using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE). We first use reports of active savings and after tax income to construct the measure of consumption implied by the budget constraint. We find that the consumption inequality implied by savings behavior largely tracks income inequality between 1980 and 2007. Second, we use a demand system to correct for systematic measurement error in the CE's expenditure data. Specifically, we consider trends in the relative expenditure of high income and low income households for different goods with different income (total expenditure) elasticities. Our estimation exploits the difference in the growth rate of luxury consumption inequality versus necessity consumption inequality. This "double-differencing,{\textquotedblright} which we implement in a a regression framework, corrects for mis-measurement that can systematically vary over time by good and income group. This second exercise indicates that consumption inequality has closely tracked income inequality over the period 1980-2007. Both of our measures show a significantly greater increase in consumption inequality than what is obtained from the CE's total household expenditure data directly.},

In this paper we use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association, the Consumer Expenditure Survey, and the United States Department of Agriculture to analyze trends in various types of food prices, to create a food price index, and to estimate the price of a calorie. Results may be used by future researchers in estimating the health implications of these trends. We find that while the general trend in food prices has been declining, that of restaurant meal prices and prices of fruits and vegetables has risen over time. It is doubtful that the decline in food prices has been sufficiently large to account for the large increase in caloric intake that is said to have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the U.S.},

  abstract = {In response to evidence linking obesity and high amounts of dietary fat, the food industry has developed numerous reduced-fat and nonfat food items. These items frequently derive a relatively large percentage of their energy from sugars and the effect of these sugars on weight regulation is not well known. We studied the comparative effects of high- and low-sucrose, low-fat, hypoenergetic diets on a variety of metabolic and behavioral indexes in a 6-wk weight-loss program. Both diets contained approximately 4606 kJ energy/d with 11\% of energy as fat, 19\% as protein, and 71\% as carbohydrate. The high-sucrose diet contained 43\% of the total daily energy intake as sucrose; the low-sucrose diet contained 4\% of the total daily energy intake as sucrose. Twenty women aged 40.6 +/- 8.2 y (mean +/- SD) with a body mass index (in kg/m2) of 35.93 +/- 4.8 consumed the high-sucrose diet; 22 women aged 40.3 +/- 7.3 y with a body mass index of 34.93 +/- 4.4 consumed the low-sucrose diet. Mixed-design analysis of variance showed a main effect of time (P \ensuremath{<} 0.01), with both diet groups showing decreases in weight, blood pressure, resting energy expenditure, percentage body fat, free triiodothyronine (FT3), urinary norepinephrine, and plasma lipids. Small but significant interactions were found between group and time in total cholesterol (P = 0.009) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P = 0.01). Both groups showed decreases in depression, hunger, and negative mood, and increases in vigilance and positive mood with time (P \ensuremath{<} 0.01). Results showed that a high sucrose content in a hypoenergetic, low-fat diet did not adversely affect weight loss, metabolism, plasma lipids, or emotional affect.},

This chapter overviews the theoretical frameworks for, and empirical evidence on, the economics of risky health behaviors. It describes traditional economic approaches emphasizing utility maximization that, under certain assumptions, result in Pareto-optimal outcomes and a limited role for policy interventions. It also details nontraditional models (e.g. involving hyperbolic time discounting or bounded rationality) that even without market imperfections can result in suboptimal outcomes for which government intervention has greater potential to increase social welfare. The chapter summarizes the literature on the consequences of risky health behaviors for economic outcomes such as medical care costs, educational attainment, employment, wages, and crime. It also reviews the research on policies and strategies with the potential to modify risky health behaviors, such as taxes or subsidies, cash incentives, restrictions on purchase and use, providing information and restricting advertising. The chapter concludes with suggestions for future research.},

The positive deviance approach could be appropriate for creating class-appropriate, healthy eating menu guides for consuming a diet to minimize cancer risk in Guatemala. Guatemalan adult participants (n = 873) were enrolled in the Concordance Project from 3 socioeconomic strata: rural area (n = 301), lower urban (n = 298), and higher urban (n = 274). Participants with intakes below recommended nutrient intakes and current smokers were excluded from the analysis. Concordance with 14 selected WCRF/AICR individual guideline components was evaluated. We selected participants for making a set of 14 rotating menus for a cancer prevention healthy eating guide. A priority sorting through the 873 participants of the survey identified a total of 23 and 21 model participants, respectively, from the rural and urban poor groups (concordant with 12 of 14 recommendation components) and 15 from the urban middle class (concordant with 11 of 14 recommendation components), with the highest degree of concordance with the WCRF/AICR guidelines. The most commonly violated recommendation was sugar consumption, followed by maintaining weight stability. The FFQ for 14 individuals from each class were transformed into a day menu to create a rotating diet guide derived from members of each social group. A potentially useful personal guide for eating compatibly with adequate nutrient intake and reduced cancer risk, appropriate to the culture and economic means of distinct social classes in Guatemala, is approaching the stage for application.},

  abstract = {Recent research has documented that income inequality in the United States has increased dramatically over the prior three decades. There has been less of a consensus, however, on whether the increase in income inequality was matched by an equally large increase in consumption inequality. Most researchers have studied this question using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) and some studies have suggested that the increase in consumption inequality has been modest. Unfortunately ,there is now mounting evidence that the CE is plagued by serious non-classical measurement error, which hinders the extent to which definitive conclusions can be made about the extent to which consumption inequality has evolved over the last three decades. In this paper, we use a variety of different techniques to overcome the measurement error problems with the CE. First, we use data from the diary component of the CE, focusing on categories where measurement error has been found to be less of an issue. Second, we explore inequality measures within the CE using the value of vehicles owned, a consumption component that is considered to be measured well. Third, we try to account directly for the non-classical measurement error of the CE by comparing the spending on luxuries (entertainment) relative to necessities (food). This is similar to the recent approach taken by Browning and Crossley (2009) and Aguiar and Bils (2011). Finally, we use expenditure data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to explore the dynamics of alternative measures of consumption inequality. All of our different methods yield similar results. We find that consumption inequality within the U.S. between 1980 and 2010 has increased by nearly the same amount as income inequality.},

  abstract = {Summary
Overeating in industrial societies is a significant problem, linked to an increasing incidence of overweight and obesity, and the resultant adverse health consequences. We advance the hypothesis that a possible explanation for overeating is that processed foods with high concentrations of sugar and other refined sweeteners, refined carbohydrates, fat, salt, and caffeine are addictive substances. Therefore, many people lose control over their ability to regulate their consumption of such foods. The loss of control over these foods could account for the global epidemic of obesity and other metabolic disorders. We assert that overeating can be described as an addiction to refined foods that conforms to the DSM-IV criteria for substance use disorders. To examine the hypothesis, we relied on experience with self-identified refined foods addicts, as well as critical reading of the literature on obesity, eating behavior, and drug addiction. Reports by self-identified food addicts illustrate behaviors that conform to the 7 DSM-IV criteria for substance use disorders. The literature also supports use of the DSM-IV criteria to describe overeating as a substance use disorder. The observational and empirical data strengthen the hypothesis that certain refined food consumption behaviors meet the criteria for substance use disorders, not unlike tobacco and alcohol. This hypothesis could lead to a new diagnostic category, as well as therapeutic approaches to changing overeating behaviors.},

Overall, there seems to be little support for the idea that income inequality is a major, generalizable determinant of population health differences within or between rich countries. Income inequality may, however, directly influence some health outcomes, such as homicide in some contexts. The strongest evidence for direct health effects is among states in the United States, but even that is somewhat mixed. Despite little support for a direct effect of income inequality on health per se, reducing income inequality by raising the incomes of the most disadvantaged will improve their health, help reduce health inequalities, and generally improve population health.},

EASI demand functions can be estimated using GMM or three stage least squares, and, like AID, an approximate EASI model can be estimated by linear regression.},

Most arguments in describing the ramifications of a tax fail to consider demand interrelationships among various beverages. To circumvent this shortcoming we employ a variation of Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model. The consumption of isotonics, regular soft drinks and fruit drinks, the set of SSBs, is negatively impacted by the proposed tax, while the consumption of fruit juices, low-fat milk, coffee, and tea is positively affected. Diversion ratios are provided identifying where the volumes of the SSBs are directed as a result of the tax policy. The reduction in the body weight as a result of a 20\% tax on SSBs is estimated to be between 1.54 and 2.55 lb per year. However, not considering demand interrelationships would result in higher weight loss. Unequivocally, it is necessary to consider interrelationships among non-alcoholic beverages in assessing the effect of the tax.},

@phdthesis{demperio_cigarette_2013,
  title = {Cigarette {{Taxes}}, {{Smoking Bans}}, and {{Smoking Behavior}}},
  abstract = {This dissertation examines the effects of policies to reduce smoking on smoking behaviors and health outcomes. In my first chapter, I estimate the effects of cigarette taxes and smoking bans. Though the effects of these policies have been studied separately, no research considers how they interact. Because smoking bans and cigarette taxes target the same behavior in the same individuals, they may reinforce each other and lead to greater reductions in smoking, or they may independently reduce smoking but experience diminishing returns together. Using data from the 1992-2007 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Surveys, I find that taxes and bans lead to significant increases in quit attempts and quits, and significant decreases in overall smoking prevalence. My results on cessation behaviors imply that these policies increased the rate of quit success, an outcome not previously studied in the literature. Furthermore, I find smaller effects on all outcomes when both taxes and bans are in place, indicating these policies are substitutes rather than complements. Next, I analyze another policy that altered the costs and benefits of smoking: the switch of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status in 1996. I examine how OTC availability, which decreased the cost of obtaining NRT and the cost of quitting, affected NRT product use and quit attempts. I find this change did not increase quit attempts but did increase NRT use, indicating that it altered how, not whether, smokers attempted to quit. I also analyze the effect of NRT use on the rate of success among quit attempts, using the OTC switch as an instrument for NRT use. I find that the use of NRT products in a quit attempt significantly increases the probability of quit success. This effect is larger than estimates without an instrument, indicating that there is self-selection into NRT product use. Last, I use variation in the timing of local smoking bans to identify the effects of bans on smoking behavior, exposure to other people's cigarette smoke, and health outcomes. Using data from the 1994-2008 California Adult Tobacco Surveys, I find that bans in bars led to a decrease in exposure but an increase in the number of cigarettes smoked at home. These results imply heterogeneous externality effects. While average exposure decreased, those living with smokers, including children, may experience increased exposure to smoke after a ban. Using hospital data from California, I will estimate the effects of bans on health outcomes. I expect that to find that bans lead to improved health outcomes for adults, but not for children.},

  abstract = {Background: How beverage taxes might influence purchases of foods and beverages among households with preschool children is unclear. Thus, we examined the relation between beverage taxes and food and beverage purchases among US households with a child 2{\textendash}5 y of age.
Objectives: We examined how a potential tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), or SSBs and \ensuremath{>}1\% fat and/or high-sugar milk, would influence household food and beverage purchases among US households with a preschool child. We aimed to identify the lowest tax rate associated with meaningful changes in purchases.
Methods: We used household food and beverage purchase data from households with a single child who participated in the 2009{\textendash}2012 Nielsen Homescan Panel. A 2-part, multilevel panel model was used to examine the relation between beverage prices and food and beverage purchases. Logistic regression was used in the first part of the model to estimate the probability of a food/beverage being purchased, whereas the second part of the model used log-linear regression to estimate predicted changes in purchases among reporting households. Estimates from both parts were combined, and bootstrapping was performed to obtain corrected SEs. In separate models, prices of SSBs, or SSBs and \ensuremath{>}1\% and/or high-sugar milk, were perturbed by +10\%, +15\%, and +20\%. Predicted changes in food and beverage purchases were compared across models.
Results: Price increases of 10\%, 15\%, and 20\% on SSBs were associated with fewer purchases of juice drinks, whereas price increases of 10\%, 15\%, and 20\% simulated on both SSBs plus \ensuremath{>}1\% fat and/or high-sugar milk (combined tax) were associated with fewer kilocalories purchased from \ensuremath{>}1\% fat, low-sugar milk, and meat, poultry, fish, and mixed meat dishes.
Conclusions: Our study provides further evidence that a tax on beverages high in sugar and/or fat may be associated with favorable changes in beverage purchases among US households with a preschool child.},

A lower percentage of SNAP participants consumed fruit (total: 35\% vs. 46\%, p = 0.001; fresh: 30\% vs. 41\%, p \&lt; 0.001) and vegetables (total: 49\% vs. 58\%, p = 0.004; fresh: 35\% vs. 47\%, p \&lt; 0.001) than those ineligible for SNAP. Among SNAP participants, cooking \&gt; 6 times/week was associated with greater vegetable consumption compared to cooking \&lt; 2 times/week (175 g vs. 98 g, p = 0.003). SNAP-eligible individuals who cooked \ensuremath{\geq} 2 times/week were more to report price (medium cookers: 47\% vs. 33\%, p = 0.001; high cookers: 52\% vs. 40\%, p \&lt; 0.001), ease of preparation (medium cookers: 36\% vs. 28\%, p = 0.002; high cookers: 36\% vs. 24\%, p \&lt; 0.001) and how long food keeps (medium cookers: 57\% vs. 45\%, p \&lt; 0.001; high cookers: 61\% vs. 50\%, p \&lt; 0.001) as important compared to SNAP-ineligible individuals.
Conclusions
Fruit and vegetable consumption in the United States is low regardless of cooking frequency. Efforts to improve diet quality should consider values on which food purchases are based.},

  abstract = {The food demand in India has been examined in the context of a structural shift in the dietary pattern of its population. The results have reinforced the hypothesis of a significant diversification in the dietary pattern of households in recent years and has found stark differences in the consumption pattern across different income quartiles. The food demand behaviour has been explained using a set of demand elasticities corresponding to major food commodities. The demand elasticities have been estimated using multi-stage budgeting with QUAIDS model and another alternative model, FCDS. The study has revealed that the estimated income elasticities vary across income classes and are lowest for cereals group and highest for horticultural and livestock products. The analysis of price and income effects based on the estimated demand system has suggested that with increase in food price inflation, the demand for staple food (rice, wheat and sugar) may not be affected adversely but, that of high-value food commodities is likely to be affected negatively. Therefore, the study has cautioned that if inflation in food prices remains unabated for an extended period, there is the possibility of reversal of the trend of diversification and that of consumers returning to cereal-dominated diet, thus accentuating under-nourishment.},

These models have been used extensively in the theoretical literature on product differentiation and the goal of this article is to translate them into a form that is useful for empirical work. Most recent econometric applications of discrete choice models implicitly let the dimension of the characteristic space increase with the number of products (they have {\textquotedblleft}tastes for products{\textquotedblright}). The two models have different theoretical properties, and these, in turn, can have quite pronounced implications for both substitution patterns and for the welfare impacts of changes in the number and characteristics of the goods marketed. After developing those properties, we provide alternative algorithms for estimating the parameters of the pure characteristic model and compare their properties to those of the algorithm for estimating the model with tastes for products. We conclude with a series of Monte Carlo results. These are designed to illustrate: (i) the computational properties of the alternative algorithms for computing the pure characteristic model, and (ii) the differences in the implications of the pure characteristic model from the models with tastes for products.},

We specify a nonparametric random utility discrete choice model of demand allowing rich preference heterogeneity, product/market unobservables, and endogenous prices. Our supply model posits nonparametric cost functions, allows latent cost shocks, and nests a range of standard oligopoly models. We consider identification of demand, identification of changes in aggregate consumer welfare, identification of marginal costs, identification of firms' marginal cost functions, and discrimination between alternative models of firm conduct. We explore two complementary approaches. The first demonstrates identification under the same nonparametric instrumental variables conditions required for identification of regression models. The second treats demand and supply in a system of nonparametric simultaneous equations, leading to constructive proofs exploiting exogenous variation in demand shifters and cost shifters. We also derive testable restrictions that provide the first general formalization of Bresnahan's (1982) intuition for empirically distinguishing between alternative models of oligopoly competition. From a practical perspective, our results clarify the types of instrumental variables needed with market level data, including tradeoffs between functional form and exclusion restrictions.},

This is based on the assumption that such taxes are largely passed through to consumers in the form of higher retail prices, leading to reduced consumption. However, relatively little is known about the extent to which taxes on SSBs are in fact passed through to consumers. We estimate the pass-through of the first city-level tax on SSBs in the U.S., which was enacted by the voters of Berkeley, California in November, 2014. We collected the prices of various brands and sizes of SSBs and other beverages before and after the implementation of the tax from a near-census of convenience stores and supermarkets in Berkeley, California. We also collected prices from stores in a control city: San Francisco, where in 2014 a similar voter referendum failed despite majority support. Estimates from difference-in-differences and other models consistently indicate that there was relatively little pass through of the Berkeley SSB tax to consumers; across brands and sizes, we estimate that retail prices rose by less than half of the amount of the tax. This is in contrast to much of the previous literature on the pass-through of taxes, which tended to find full or even overshifting of taxes.},

The government provides goods and services such as registration of births and deaths, public health surveillance of disease and injury, outbreak investigations, research and education, health insurance for the poor and elderly, enforcement of laws and regulations, evaluation of health promotion programs, and assurance of a competent healthy workforce. In the past, economics in public health has almost exclusively focused on efficiency of programs through the use of cost-effectiveness or net present value measures clustered under the rubric of "economic evaluation." Efficiency measures are useful at the programmatic level. However, lack of full employment and market failures including public goods and the impact of consumers and producers actions not reflected in the markets (externalities) not only compromise efficiency but also generate health inequities. We propose an expansion of the scope of existing health economics research in an area characterized as public health economics-the study of the economic role of government in public health, particularly, but not exclusively, in supplying public goods and addressing externalities., (C) 2007 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommends limiting total intake of discretionary calories, including both added sugars and solid fats, to 5\%-15\% per day (4). Recent analyses indicate that children and adolescents obtain approximately 16\% of their total caloric intake from added sugars (5). This data brief presents results for consumption of added sugars among U.S. adults for 2005-2010. Results are presented by sex, age, race and ethnicity, income, type of food consumed (food or beverage), and location of consumption.},

  abstract = {Thirty years ago international nutritionists were focussing on childhood malnutrition, the `protein gap' and how to feed the world's burgeoning population, and medical services in the developing world were concentrated on the fight against infectious diseases. Today the World Health Organization (WHO) finds itself needing to deal with the new pandemic of obesity and its accompanying non-communicable diseases (NCDs) while the challenge of childhood malnutrition has far from disappeared, TB and malaria rates are escalating, and the scourge of AIDS has emerged. This has created a `double burden' of disease that threatens to overwhelm the health services of many resource-poor countries. WHO warns that the greater future burden of obesity and diabetes will affect developing countries, and the projected numbers of new cases of diabetes run into the hundreds of millions within the next 2 decades. The obesity pandemic originated in the US and crossed to Europe and the world's other rich nations before, remarkably, it penetrated even the world's poorest countries especially in their urban areas. The pandemic is transmitted through the vectors of subsidized agriculture and multinational companies providing cheap, highly refined fats, oils, and carbohydrates, labour-saving mechanized devices, affordable motorized transport, and the seductions of sedentary pastimes such as television. This paper briefly reviews these macro-environmental trends as well as considering some of the socio-behavioural influences on weight gain in traditional societies. It concludes, pessimistically, that the pandemic will continue to spread for the foreseeable future, and that, apart from educational campaigns, the governments and health services of poor countries will have few effective public health levers with which they can try to arrest the trend.},

  abstract = {We review research on revenue models used by online firms who offer digital goods. Such goods are nonrival, have near zero marginal cost of production and distribution, low marginal cost of consumer search and low transaction costs. Additionally, firms can easily observe and measure consumer behavior. We start by asking what consumers can offer in exchange for digital goods. We suggest that consumers can offer their money, personal information, or time. Firms, in turn, can generate revenue by selling digital content, brokering consumer information, or showing advertising. We discuss the firm's trade-off in choosing between the different revenue streams, such as offering paid content or free content while relying on advertising revenues. We then turn to specific challenges firms face when choosing a revenue model based on either content, information or advertising. Additionally, we discuss nascent revenue models that combine different revenue streams such as crowdfunding (content and information) or blogs (information and advertising). We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for future research including implications for firms' revenues models from the increasing importance of the mobile internet.},

The approach preserves the behavioral information expressed by zero expenditures and conforms with the requirements imposed by consumer theory in a way consistent with the random utility hypothesis. We motivate the choice of the Tobit model as a statistical representation of consumer behavior and introduce the methodology by specifying the AIDS model modified according to both a translating and scaling demographic transformation. We propose to estimate each demand equation in unrestricted form using the jackknife technique. We then recover the demand parameters imposing the cross-equations restrictions by using minimum distance estimation. The empirical results of the censored demand system for specific households of policy relevance are reported.},

  abstract = {Product aggregation levels in the seafood demand literature are normally selected based on the research objectives rather than on empirical tests. This study applies the generalized composite commodity theorem (GCCT) developed by Lewbel (1996), to test the aggregation of French household demand of salmon. The results indicate that demand for salmon can be aggregated based on product form (i.e., fresh, frozen, and smoked salmon). These composites can be further aggregated into a single salmon category. Salmon demand can, therefore, be estimated using a system which only includes salmon equations. The composite demand elasticities estimated by the AIDS model suggest that fresh and smoked salmon significantly substitute each other in the French salmon market. This means that the estimation of an import demand system that does not include smoked salmon cannot really explain real consumer demand. The results also suggest that wild salmon is playing in a different market niche than farmed salmon.},

On balance, smokers probably pay their way at the current level of excise taxes on cigarettes; but one may, nonetheless, wish to raise those taxes to reduce the number of adolescent smokers. In contrast, drinkers do not pay their way: current excise taxes on alcohol cover only about half the costs imposed on others.(JAMA. 1989;261:1604-1609)},

Contrary to conventional wisdom, the formulas imply that the economic incidence of a tax depends on its statutory incidence and that a tax can create deadweight loss even if it induces no change in demand. The results are derived using simple supply and demand diagrams and familiar notions of consumer and producer surplus. The approach to welfare analysis proposed here yields robust formulas because it does not require specification of a positive theory for why agents fail to optimize with respect to tax policies.},

Most reliable information from each sample is exploited to derive a correction for the measurement error affecting observed measures of consumption inequality in the two surveys. We find that consumption inequality, as measured by the standard deviation of log non-durable consumption, has increased by roughly 5\% points during the 1990s.},

  abstract = {We use the Anti-Alcohol Campaign in 1986 and the rapid expansion of the beer market after the collapse of the Soviet Union as two quasi-natural experiments to identify highly persistent habit formation in alcohol consumption among Russian males. Importantly, these results apply to all levels of alcohol consumption and are not driven by heavy drinking or alcoholism. The two large shocks combined with persistent habits lead to large cohort differences in consumer behavior even decades later. We derive a basic model of habit formation with homogeneous preferences over two habit-forming goods, which is consistent with these facts. Using placebo tests as well as simple descriptive statistics, we show that habits are formed during early adulthood and remain largely unaffected afterward. The main alternative hypotheses such as income effects, unobserved taste heterogeneity, stepping-stone effects, and changes in culture or social norms are inconsistent with those patterns. Using the experiments as IVs, we estimate the first-order autoregressive coefficient to be 0.83, which is almost three times larger than its OLS estimate. Finally, our results suggest that male mortality in Russia will decrease by one quarter within twenty years even under current policies and prices due to the long-run consequences of the large changes in the alcohol market.},

While the original work of Oaxaca and Blinder considered the case of the mean, our main focus is on other distributional statistics besides the mean, such as quantiles, the Gini coefficient or the variance. We discuss the assumptions required for identifying the different elements of the decomposition, as well as various estimation methods proposed in the literature.

In particular, we make recommendations on four aspects of the process: computational practice, published reporting, supporting documentation, and visualization. Also, we reflect on current developments in the practice of computing and visualization, such as integrated dynamic electronic documents, distributed computing systems, open source software, and their potential usefulness in making computational and empirical research in economics more easily reproducible.},

I find demand elasticities with respect to the home state price are indistinguishable from zero on average and vary significantly with the distance individuals live to a lower-price border. However, when smuggling incentives are eradicated, the price elasticity is negative but still inelastic. I also estimate between 13 and 25 percent of consumers purchase cigarettes in border localities. The central implication of this study is cross-border smuggling confounds many of the potential health and revenue gains from cigarette taxation.},

This paper estimates the extent to which (falling) housing prices and (rising) social transfers can account for this fact using a spatial equilibrium model. Nonlinear reduced form estimates of the model using U.S. Census data document that positive labor demand shocks increase population more than negative shocks reduce population, this asymmetry is larger for low-skill workers, and such an asymmetry is absent for wages, housing values, and rental prices. GMM estimates of the full model suggest that the comparative immobility of low-skill workers is not due to higher mobility costs per se, but rather a lower incidence of adverse labor demand shocks.},

This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (tax or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. Methods: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. Findings: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low{\textendash}socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity. Conclusions: The limited existing evidence suggests that small taxes or subsidies are not likely to produce significant changes in BMI or obesity prevalence but that nontrivial pricing interventions may have some measurable effects on Americans' weight outcomes, particularly for children and adolescents, low-SES populations, and those most at risk for overweight. Additional research is needed to be able to draw strong policy conclusions regarding the effectiveness of fiscal-pricing interventions aimed at reducing obesity.},

  doi = {10.1093/restud/rdt044},
  abstract = {We propose robust methods for inference about the effect of a treatment variable on a scalar outcome in the presence of very many regressors in a model with possibly non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic disturbances. We allow for the number of regressors to be larger than the sample size. To make informative inference feasible, we require the model to be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding factors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by including a relatively small number of variables whose identities are unknown. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by selecting approximately the right set of regressors. We develop a novel estimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in this setting, called the {\textquotedblleft}post-double-selection{\textquotedblright} method. The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect selection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid uniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model selection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases with a small, fixed number of controls. Thus, our method resolves the problem of uniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of models. We also present a generalization of our method to a fully heterogeneous model with a binary treatment variable. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical simulations and an application that considers the effect of abortion on crime rates.},

The evidence on this association between countries is mixed,1{\textendash}4 but income inequality and health have been linked within the United States,5{\textendash}11 Britain,12 and Brazil.13 Questions remain over how to interpret these findings and the mechanisms involved. We discuss three interpretations of the association between income inequality and health: the individual income interpretation, the psychosocial environment interpretation, and the neo-material interpretation.

\#\#\#\# Summary points

Income inequality has generally been associated with differences in health

A psychosocial interpretation of health inequalities, in terms of perceptions of relative disadvantage and the psychological consequences of inequality, raises several conceptual and empirical problems

Income inequality is accompanied by many differences in conditions of life at the individual and population levels, which may adversely influence health

Interpretation of links between income inequality and health must begin with the structural causes of inequalities, and not just focus on perceptions of that inequality

Reducing health inequalities and improving public health in the 21st century requires strategic investment in neo-material conditions via more equitable distribution of public and private resources

We reviewed the literature through traditional and electronic means and supplemented this with correlational analyses of gross domestic product and life expectancy and of income inequality and mortality trends based on data from the World Bank,14 the World Health Organization,15 and two British sources.16 17

According to the individual income interpretation, aggregate level associations between income inequality and health reflect only the individual level association between income and health. The curvilinear relation between income and health at the individual level 18 19 is a sufficient condition to produce health differences between populations with the same average income but different distributions of income.3 20 This interpretation assumes that determinants {\ldots}},

We argue that traditional quantity-based measures of incidence are only appropriate under a very restrictive {\textquotedblleft}time-consistent{\textquotedblright} model of consumption of sin goods. A model that is much more consistent with existing evidence on smoking decisions is a time-inconsistent formulation where excise taxes on cigarettes serve a self-control function that is valued by smokers who would like to quit but cannot. This self-control function benefits lower income groups more, since they have a significantly higher price sensitivity of smoking. Calibrations show that, as a result, cigarette taxes are much less regressive than previously assumed, and are even progressive for a wide variety of parameter values.},

We consider implementing these models in settings with complicated products where consumer preferences for product attributes are sparse, that is, where a small proportion of a high-dimensional product characteristics influence consumer tastes. We propose a multistep estimator to efficiently perform uniform inference. Our estimator employs a penalized pre-estimation model specification stage to consistently estimate nonlinear features of the BLP model. We then perform selection via a Triple-LASSO for explanatory controls, treatment selection controls, and instrument selection. After selecting variables, we use an unpenalized GMM estimator for inference. Monte Carlo simulations verify the performance of these estimators.},

Price elasticities for foods and nonalcoholic beverages ranged from 0.27 to 0.81 (absolute values), with food away from home, soft drinks, juice, and meats being most responsive to price changes (0.7{\textendash}0.8). As an example, a 10\% increase in soft drink prices should reduce consumption by 8\% to 10\%., Studies estimating price effects on substitutions from unhealthy to healthy food and price responsiveness among at-risk populations are particularly needed.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground
The theory that income inequality and characteristics of the psychosocial environment (indexed by such things as social capital and sense of control over life's circumstances) are key determinants of health and could account for health differences between countries has become influential in health inequalities research and for population health policy.
Methods
We examined cross-sectional associations between income inequality and low birthweight, life expectancy, self-rated health, and age-specific and cause-specific mortality among countries providing data in wave III (around 1989{\textendash}92) of the Luxembourg Income Study. We also used data from the 1990{\textendash}91 wave of the World Values Survey (WVS). We obtained life expectancy, mortality, and low birthweight data from the WHO Statistical Information System.
Findings
Among the countries studied, higher income inequality was strongly associated with greater infant mortality (r=0\ensuremath{\cdot}69, p=0\ensuremath{\cdot}004 for women; r=0\ensuremath{\cdot}74, p=0\ensuremath{\cdot}002 for men). Associations between income inequality and mortality declined with age at death, and then reversed among those aged 65 years and older. Income inequality was inconsistently associated with specific causes of death and was not associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), breast or prostate cancer, cirrhosis, or diabetes mortality. Countries that had greater trade union membership and political representation by women had better child mortality profiles. Differences between countries in levels of social capital showed generally weak and somewhat inconsistent associations with cause-specific and age-specific mortality.
Interpretation
Income inequality and characteristics of the psychosocial environment like trust, control, and organisational membership do not seem to be key factors in understanding health differences between these wealthy countries. The associations that do exist are largely limited to child health outcomes and cirrhosis. Explanations for between-country differences in health will require an appreciation of the complex interactions of history, culture, politics, economics, and the status of women and ethnic minorities.},

This study provided a systematic review of recent U.S. studies on the price elasticity of demand for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), fast food, and fruits and vegetables, as well as the direct associations of prices/taxes with body weight outcomes. Based on the recent literature, the price elasticity of demand for SSBs, fast food, fruits and vegetables was estimated to be -1.21, -0.52, -0.49 and -0.48, respectively. The studies that linked soda taxes to weight outcomes showed minimal impacts on weight; however, they were based on existing state-level sales taxes that were relatively low. Higher fast-food prices were associated with lower weight outcomes particularly among adolescents, suggesting that raising prices would potentially impact weight outcomes. Lower fruit and vegetable prices were generally found to be associated with lower body weight outcomes among both low-income children and adults, suggesting that subsidies that would reduce the cost of fruits and vegetables for lower-socioeconomic populations may be effective in reducing obesity. Pricing instruments should continue to be considered and evaluated as potential policy instruments to address public health risks.},

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews XX(X), XXX{\textendash}XXX]. The experimental question is whether or not sugar can be a substance of abuse and lead to a natural form of addiction. {\textquotedblleft}Food addiction{\textquotedblright} seems plausible because brain pathways that evolved to respond to natural rewards are also activated by addictive drugs. Sugar is noteworthy as a substance that releases opioids and dopamine and thus might be expected to have addictive potential. This review summarizes evidence of sugar dependence in an animal model. Four components of addiction are analyzed. {\textquotedblleft}Bingeing,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}withdrawal,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}craving{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}cross-sensitization{\textquotedblright} are each given operational definitions and demonstrated behaviorally with sugar bingeing as the reinforcer. These behaviors are then related to neurochemical changes in the brain that also occur with addictive drugs. Neural adaptations include changes in dopamine and opioid receptor binding, enkephalin mRNA expression and dopamine and acetylcholine release in the nucleus accumbens. The evidence supports the hypothesis that under certain circumstances rats can become sugar dependent. This may translate to some human conditions as suggested by the literature on eating disorders and obesity.},

Obesity is associated with increased risk of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension, cardiovascular disease, gallbladder disease and cholecystectomy, and colon and postmenopausal breast cancer.

Indirect costs due to morbidity and mortality were discounted at 4\%. Overall, the costs attributable to obesity were {\textdollar}11.3 billion for NIDDM, {\textdollar}22.2 billion for cardiovascular disease, {\textdollar}2.4 billion for gall bladder disease, {\textdollar}1.5 billion for hypertension, and {\textdollar}1.9 billion for breast and colon cancer. Thus a conservative estimate of the economic costs of obesity was {\textdollar}39.3 billion, or 5.5\% of the costs of illness in 1986. Addition of costs due to musculoskeletal disorders could raise this estimate to 7.8\%. The costs of treatment for severe obesity must be weighed against the improved health status and quality of life.},

  abstract = {Obesity represents a major threat to health and quality of life. Although obesity has strong genetic determinants, it is generally accepted that it results from an imbalance between food intake and daily physical activity. Health guidelines have been focused on 3 particular lifestyle factors: increased levels of physical activity and reductions in the intakes of fat and sugars. The dietary guidelines, especially, are under debate. This review covers evidence from carefully controlled laboratory studies, clinical trials, studies in populations at high risk of developing obesity, and epidemiologic studies on the role of sugars, particularly sucrose, in the development of obesity. Although many environmental factors promote a positive energy balance, it is clear that the consumption of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet increases the likelihood of weight gain. The evidence related to carbohydrate, particularly sugars, and the type of food (solid or liquid) is less clear because the number of long-term ad libitum dietary intervention trials is very small. Data on sucrose intake in relation to metabolism and weight gain do not associate high consumption of sucrose with the prevalence of obesity. The evidence supports the current dietary guidelines for reducing fat intake. However, the effect of the carbohydrate source and class and of the form in which carbohydrate is consumed (solid or liquid) on body weight control requires further consideration.},

  abstract = {Public attitudes about dietary sugars have varied over time, depending on numerous factors including consensus and emerging science, public policy, and consumer attention. The rise of obesity, the increasing concern over its associated health consequences, and the role of sugars in the diet continue to be examined by the scientific community. The media, which closely monitor scientific publications and policy development, endeavor to communicate these research findings, along with policy debates, as information for the general public. Because consumers tend to get most of their health and nutrition information from the media, they have been exposed to a significant amount of information on dietary sugars. This article describes how scientific findings and nutrition policy discussions affect media reports and, consequently, consumer perceptions about dietary sugars including obesity, low-carbohydrate diets, the glycemic index, and high-fructose corn syrup.},

Some have proposed vending machine restrictions and taxing soft drinks to curb children's consumption of soft drinks; to a large extent, these policies have not been evaluated empirically. We examine these policies using two nationally representative data sets and find no evidence that, as currently practiced, either is effective at reducing children's weight. We conclude by outlining changes that may increase their effectiveness, such as implementing comprehensive restrictions on access to soft drinks in schools and imposing higher tax rates than are currently in place in many jurisdictions. {[}PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In a similar case study of pantry staples such as salt and sugar, we show that chefs devote 12 percentage points less of their purchases to national brands than demographically similar non-chefs. We extend our analysis to cover 50 retail health categories and 241 food and drink categories. The results suggest that misinformation explains a sizable share of the brand premium for health products, and a much smaller share for most food and drink products.

  abstract = {Introduction
Reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption through taxation is a promising public health response to the obesity epidemic in the U.S. This study quantifies the expected health and economic benefits of a national sugar-sweetened beverage excise tax of {\textdollar}0.01/ounce over 10 years.
Methods
A cohort model was used to simulate the impact of the tax on BMI. Assuming ongoing implementation and effect maintenance, quality-adjusted life-years gained and disability-adjusted life-years and healthcare costs averted were estimated over the 2015{\textendash}2025 period for the 2015 U.S. population. Costs and health gains were discounted at 3\% annually. Data were analyzed in 2014.
Results
Implementing the tax nationally would cost {\textdollar}51 million in the first year. The tax would reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 20\% and mean BMI by 0.16 (95\% uncertainty interval {[}UI]=0.06, 0.37) units among youth and 0.08 (95\% UI=0.03, 0.20) units among adults in the second year for a cost of {\textdollar}3.16 (95\% UI={\textdollar}1.24, {\textdollar}8.14) per BMI unit reduced. From 2015 to 2025, the policy would avert 101,000 disability-adjusted life-years (95\% UI=34,800, 249,000); gain 871,000 quality-adjusted life-years (95\% UI=342,000, 2,030,000); and result in {\textdollar}23.6 billion (95\% UI={\textdollar}9.33 billion, {\textdollar}54.9 billion) in healthcare cost savings. The tax would generate {\textdollar}12.5 billion in annual revenue (95\% UI={\textdollar}8.92, billion, {\textdollar}14.1 billion).
Conclusions
The proposed tax could substantially reduce BMI and healthcare expenditures and increase healthy life expectancy. Concerns regarding the potentially regressive tax may be addressed by reduced obesity disparities and progressive earmarking of tax revenue for health promotion.},

In this interpretation, cognitive and emotional processes are discrete and produced by two different systems: a cognitive and an emotional system. While cognitive biases are influences that affect rationality from within the cognitive system, emotional biases refer to those influences that affect the cognitive system from outside. Unfortunately, the assumption that rationality is a pure cognitive process is not well motivated. What I will suggest in the following is that rationality is the consequence of the intrinsic and inseparable interaction between cognition and emotions rather than the result of an independent cognitive process influenced by the latter. As a matter of fact, this is the general understanding of rationality that many scientists vindicate. If that is true, the claim has important consequences for our understanding of both rationality and emotional biases.},

To analyze their impact on the public policy we propose a very simple two-agent partial equilibrium model in the technological context of externalities. In a static framework, the centralized solution always implies an optimal policy, which may consist of taxation or subsidization depending on the individual optimum and on the technology parameters. In a dynamic model with local knowledge of the efficiency function and instantaneous output adjustments, such an optimal policy can be structurally stable or unstable. In the latter case, under small changes of the parameters the policy may switch from low taxation/subsidization to high taxation/subsidization or vice versa, or even jump discontinuously from taxation to subsidization or vice versa. Furthermore, the decentralized solution based upon "tradable rights" can be economically equivalent to the centralized solution in the form of taxation policy but the two solutions may be not politically equivalent. {[}PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Since Edward Leamer's memorable 1983 paper, "Let's Take the Con out of Econometrics," empirical microeconomics has experienced a credibility revolution. While Leamer's suggested remedy, sensitivity analysis, has played a role in this, we argue that the primary engine driving improvement has been a focus on the quality of empirical research designs. The advantages of a good research design are perhaps most easily apparent in research using random assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's 1983 critique and his proposed remedies. We then turn to the key factors we see contributing to improved empirical work, including the availability of more and better data, along with advances in theoretical econometric understanding, but especially the fact that research design has moved front and center in much of empirical micro. We offer a brief digression into macroeconomics and industrial organization, where progress--by our lights--is less dramatic, although there is work in both fields that we find encouraging. Finally, we discuss the view that the design pendulum has swung too far. Critics of design-driven studies argue that in pursuit of clean and credible research designs, researchers seek good answers instead of good questions. We briefly respond to this concern, which worries us little.},

Positive internal innovation has long been a central element of African agricultural development, even if modern efforts to stimulate technical, institutional, and policy innovations in African agriculture have tended to look outwards.

Positive deviance and appreciative inquiry are suggested as organizing frameworks for identifying and amplifying the generation and uptake of internal African innovations.},

It also examines the extent to which obesity imposes negative externalities, and economic interventions that could potentially internalize such externalities, such as food taxes, subsidies for school-based physical activity programs, and financial rewards for weight loss. It discusses other economic rationales for government intervention with respect to obesity, such as imperfect information, time inconsistent preferences, and irrational behavior. It concludes by proposing a research agenda for the field.

Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no single dominant economic cause of obesity; a wide variety of factors may contribute a modest amount to the risk. There is consistent evidence regarding the economic consequences of obesity, which are lower wages and higher medical care costs that impose negative externalities through health insurance. Studies of economic approaches to preventing obesity, such as menu labeling, taxes on energy-dense foods, and financial rewards for weight loss find only modest effects on weight and thus a range of policies may be necessary to have a substantial effect on the prevalence of obesity.},

  title = {Chapter 26 {{Tax}} incidence},
  volume = {4},
  abstract = {This chapter reviews the concepts, methods, and results of studies that analyze the incidence of taxes. The purpose of such studies is to determine how the burden of a particular tax is allocated among consumers through higher product prices, workers through a lower wage rate, or other factors of production through lower rates of return to those factors. The methods might involve simple partial equilibrium models, analytical general equilibrium models, or computable general equilibrium models.

In a partial equilibrium model, the burden of a tax is shown to depend on the elasticity of supply relative to the elasticity of demand. Partial equilibrium models also are used to consider cases with imperfect competition.

In a two-sector general equilibrium model, a tax might be imposed on either commodity, on either factor of production, or on a factor used in one sector. The original use of this model is to analyze the corporate income tax as a tax on capital used only in one sector, the corporate sector. The model can be used to show when the burden falls only on capital or when the burden is shared with labor. The model also has been applied to the property tax, and results of the model have been used to calculate the overall burden on each income group.

Because the total stock of capital is fixed in that model, however, dynamic models are required to show how a tax on capital affects capital accumulation, future wage rates, and overall burdens. Such models might also provide analytical results or computational results. The most elaborate recent models calculate the lifetime incidence of each group. Finally, the chapter reviews the use of such incidence methods and results in the policy process.},

Design: Ecological study of 21 developed countries. Countries: Countries were eligible for inclusion if they were among the top 50 countries with the highest gross national income per capita by purchasing power parity in 2002, had a population over 3 million, and had available data on income inequality and outcome measures. Main outcome measures: Percentage of obese (body mass index \ensuremath{>}30) adult men and women, diabetes mortality rates, and calorie consumption per capita per day. Results: Adjusting for gross national per capita income, income inequality was positively correlated with the percentage of obese men (r=0.48, p=0.03), the percentage of obese women (r=0.62, p=0.003), diabetes mortality rates per 1 million people (r=0.46, p=0.04), and average calories per capita per day (r=0.50, p=0.02). Correlations were stronger if analyses were weighted for population size. The effect of income inequality on female obesity was independent of average calorie intake. Conclusions: Obesity, diabetes mortality, and calorie consumption were associated with income inequality in developed countries. Increased nutritional problems may be a consequence of the psychosocial impact of living in a more hierarchical society.},

  abstract = {Purpose
Soft drink consumption has been linked with higher energy intake, obesity, and poorer health. Fiscal pricing policies such as soda taxes may lower soda consumption and, in turn, reduce weight among U.S. adolescents.
Methods
This study used multivariate linear regression analyses to examine the associations between state-level grocery store and vending machine soda taxes and adolescent body mass index (BMI). We used repeated cross-sections of individual-level data on adolescents drawn from the Monitoring the Future surveys combined with state-level tax data and local area contextual measures for the years 1997 through 2006.
Results
The results showed no statistically significant associations between state-level soda taxes and adolescent BMI. Only a weak economic and statistically significant effect was found between vending machine soda tax rates and BMI among teens at risk for overweight.
Conclusions
Current state-level tax rates are not found to be significantly associated with adolescent weight outcomes. It is likely that taxes would need to be raised substantially to detect significant associations between taxes and adolescent weight.},

We offer an illustration of how one can take into account the uncertainty related to both demand estimation and health estimates and to produce confidence intervals for the overall health effects instead of only point estimates. Taxation of sugar could lead to a statistically significant reduction in both the incidence of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. The health effects appear to be most pronounced for low-income individuals, and the reforms may therefore reduce health inequality. This effect undermines the traditional regressivity argument against the heavy taxation of unhealthy food.},

  abstract = {Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S., with now almost a third of children ages 2-19 deemed overweight or obese. In this study, we leverage recent findings from behavioral economics to explore new approaches to tackling one aspect of childhood obesity: food choice and consumption. Using a field experiment where we include more than 1,500 children, we report several key insights. First, we find that individual incentives can have large influences: in the control, only 17\% of children prefer the healthy snack, whereas the introduction of small incentives increases take-up of the healthy snack to roughly 75\%, more than a four-fold increase. There is some evidence that the effects continue after the treatment period, consistent with a model of habit formation. Second, we find little evidence that the framing of incentives (loss versus gain) matters. While incentives work, we find that educational messaging alone has little influence on food choice. Yet, we do observe an important interaction effect between messaging and incentives: together they provide an important influence on food choice. For policymakers, our findings show the power of using incentives to combat childhood obesity. For academics, our approach opens up an interesting combination of theory and experiment that can lead to a better understanding of theories that explain healthy decisions and what incentives can influence them.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the quantitative effects of using economic instruments in health policy on the basis of price elasticities calculated from estimated demand systems. The nutritional effects of various taxation schemes are compared for households in different age groups and social classes. Focusing on the consumption of saturated fats, fibre and sugar; it is generally found that the impact of price instruments is stronger for lower social classes than in other groups of the population. With regard to age groups, it is mostly the youngest that decrease their demand for saturated fat in response to price changes, while it is mostly the middle-aged who exhibit price responsiveness in their demand for sugar. These groups are however not considered as key target groups for dietary regulation; thus tax instruments may be effective in improving diets on average, but the design of the instruments and the targeting of vulnerable groups with special needs should be done with care. It should be noted that a tax on a single nutrient or food may have undesired effects on the demand for other food components, though this may be avoided by introducing taxes/subsidies on several food products simultaneously.},

The effects on vegetable purchases of either removing the value added tax on vegetables or a general income support are investigated. Adverse health effects are most serious in households consuming low quantities of vegetables. Therefore, the effects on high- and low-consuming households are estimated by using quantile regressions (QRs). Since many households did not purchase any vegetable during each survey period, censored as well as ordinary QRs are used. Our results suggest that the effects of the policy variables differ in different parts of the conditional distribution of vegetable purchases. None of the proposed policy options is likely to substantially increase vegetable purchases among low-consuming households.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the opinions of stakeholders on strategies to improve dietary quality of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants.
DESIGN: Participants answered a thirty-eight-item web-based survey assessing opinions and perceptions of SNAP and programme policy changes.
SETTING USA SUBJECTS: Survey of 522 individuals with stakeholder interest in SNAP, conducted in October through December 2011.
RESULTS: The top three barriers to improving dietary quality identified were: (i) unhealthy foods marketed in low-income communities; (ii) the high cost of healthy foods; and (iii) lifestyle challenges faced by low-income individuals. Many respondents (70 \%) also disagreed that current SNAP benefit levels were adequate to maintain a healthy diet. Stakeholders believed that vouchers, coupons or monetary incentives for purchasing healthful foods might have the greatest potential for improving the diets of SNAP participants. Many respondents (78 \%) agreed that sodas should not be eligible for purchases with SNAP benefits. More than half (55 \%) believed retailers could easily implement such restrictions. A majority of respondents (58 \%) agreed that stores should stock a minimum quantity of healthful foods in order to be certified as a SNAP retailer, and most respondents (83 \%) believed that the US Department of Agriculture should collect data on the foods purchased with SNAP benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that there is broad stakeholder support for policies that align SNAP purchase eligibility with national public health goals of reducing food insecurity, improving nutrition and preventing obesity.},

  abstract = {The taxation of diesel fuel varies by use. Consumers using diesel fuel on-road must pay state and federal highway taxes while diesel fuel consumed for residential heating, industrial use, farming or off-road travel do not pay taxes. Variation in the taxation of diesel fuel creates the incentive for firms and individuals to evade on-road diesel taxes. Firms evading on-road diesel taxes purchase untaxed diesel fuel and then use or resell it for on-road use. This paper studies the incentives for tax evasion and the effects of regulatory changes meant to limit evasion of on-road diesel taxes. We propose a model of fuel tax evasion in which firms choose to purchase quantities of taxed and untaxed diesel fuel based on a heterogenous cost of evading and an endogenously set level of regulatory enforcement. In addition, we empirically study the effects of regulatory innovation in October 1993, including the addition of dye to untaxed diesel fuel, which increase the costs of evasion and lower the costs of regulatory enforcement. We estimate the effect of the regulatory changes on statelevel sales of diesel fuel and untaxed heating oil. We find that sales of diesel fuel rose 35 percent following the regulatory change while sales of untaxed heating oil fell by a similar amount. This suggests that the regulatory changes substantially limited the amount of diesel fuel tax evasion. In addition, we exploit differences in state-level on-road diesel taxes as a source of variation in the incentive for evasion. We find evidence consistent with the comparative statics of our model- the change in the sales of diesel fuel following the regulations were greater in areas with higher state on-road diesel taxes.

  title = {Why {{Surplus Consumption}} in the {{Habit Model May}} be {{Less Persistent}} than {{You Think}}},
  abstract = {In U.S. data, value stocks have higher expected excess returns and higher CAPM alphas than growth stocks. We find the external-habit model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) can generate a value premium in both CAPM alpha and expected excess return so long as the persistence of the log surplus-consumption ratio is not too high. In contrast, Lettau and Wachter (2007) find that when the log surplus-consumption ratio is assumed to be highly persistent as in Campbell and Cochrane, the external-habit model generates a growth premium in expected excess return. However, the micro evidence favors a less persistent log surplus-consumption ratio. We choose a value for this persistence which is sufficiently low that the most recent 2 years of log consumption contribute over 98\% of all past consumption to log habit, which is a much more reasonable number than the 25\% contribution generated by the Lettau-Wachter value. In our model, expected consumption is slowly mean-reverting, as in the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), which is why our model is able to generate a price-dividend ratio for aggregate equity that exhibits the high autocorrelation found in the data, despite the very low persistence of the price-of-risk state variable. Our results suggest that an external habit model in the spirit of Campbell and Cochrane can deliver an empirically sensible value premium once the persistence of the surplus consumption ratio is calibrated to the micro evidence rather than set to a value close to one. When we allow the conditional volatility of consumption growth to also be slowly mean reverting as in the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron, our model is also able to generate empirically sensible predictability of long-horizon returns using the price-dividend ratio, without eroding the value premium. Our results also suggest that models with fast-moving habit can deliver several empirical properties of aggregate dividend strips that have been recently documented.},

We assessed the short-term ability to increase retail prices of the first US 1-cent-per-ounce excise tax on the distribution of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), which was implemented in March 2015 by Berkeley, California., Methods. In 2014 and 2015, we examined pre- to posttax price changes of SSBs and non-SSBs in a variety of retailers in Berkeley and in the comparison cities Oakland and San Francisco, California. We examined price changes by beverage, brand, size, and retailer type., Results. For smaller beverages (\ensuremath{\leq}\hspace{0.167em}33.8 oz), price increases (cents/oz) in Berkeley relative to those in comparison cities were 0.69 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}0.36, 1.03) for soda, 0.47 (95\% CI\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}0.08, 0.87) for fruit-flavored beverages, and 0.47 (95\% CI\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}0.25, 0.69) for SSBs overall. For 2-liter bottles and multipacks of soda, relative price increases were 0.46 (95\% CI\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}0.03, 0.89) and 0.49 (95\% CI\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}0.21, 0.77). We observed no relative price increases for nontaxed beverages overall., Conclusions. Approximately 3 months after the tax was implemented, SSB retail prices increased more in Berkeley than in nearby cities, marking a step in the causal pathway between the tax and reduced SSB consumption.},

Using econometric models of repeated cross-sectional data on diabetes and nutritional components of food from 175 countries, we found that every 150 kcal/person/day increase in sugar availability (about one can of soda/day) was associated with increased diabetes prevalence by 1.1\% (p \ensuremath{<}0.001) after testing for potential selection biases and controlling for other food types (including fibers, meats, fruits, oils, cereals), total calories, overweight and obesity, period-effects, and several socioeconomic variables such as aging, urbanization and income. No other food types yielded significant individual associations with diabetes prevalence after controlling for obesity and other confounders. The impact of sugar on diabetes was independent of sedentary behavior and alcohol use, and the effect was modified but not confounded by obesity or overweight. Duration and degree of sugar exposure correlated significantly with diabetes prevalence in a dose-dependent manner, while declines in sugar exposure correlated with significant subsequent declines in diabetes rates independently of other socioeconomic, dietary and obesity prevalence changes. Differences in sugar availability statistically explain variations in diabetes prevalence rates at a population level that are not explained by physical activity, overweight or obesity.},

  abstract = {The widely used estimator of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) produces estimates of consumer preferences from a discrete-choice demand model with random coefficients, market-level demand shocks, and endogenous prices. We derive numerical theory results characterizing the properties of the nested fixed point algorithm used to evaluate the objective function of BLP's estimator. We discuss problems with typical implementations, including cases that can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. As a solution, we recast estimation as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which can be faster and which avoids the numerical issues associated with nested inner loops. The advantages are even more pronounced for forward-looking demand models where the Bellman equation must also be solved repeatedly. Several Monte Carlo and real-data experiments support our numerical concerns about the nested fixed point approach and the advantages of constrained optimization. For static BLP, the constrained optimization approach can be as much as ten to forty times faster for large-dimensional problems with many markets.},

  abstract = {American metropolitan areas have experienced rising residential segregation by income since 1970. One potential explanation for this change is growing income inequality. However, measures of residential sorting are typically mechanically related to the income distribution, making it difficult to identify the impact of inequality on residential choice. This paper presents a measure of residential segregation by income, the Centile Gap Index (CGI), which is based on income percentiles. Using the CGI, I find that a one standard deviation increase in income inequality raises residential income segregation by 0.4-0.9 standard deviations. Inequality at the top of the distribution is associated with more segregation of the rich, while inequality at the bottom and declines in labor demand for less-skilled men are associated with residential isolation of the poor. Inequality can fully explain the rise in income segregation between 1970 and 2000.},

A team including registered dietitians, a food scientist and programmers developed a batch-mode ingredient matching and linear programming (LP) approach to estimate the amount of each ingredient needed in a given product to produce a nutrient profile similar to that reported on its nutrition facts label (NFL). Added sugar content was estimated for 7021 products available in 2007{\textendash}08 that contain sugar from ten beverage categories. Of these, flavored waters had the lowest added sugar amounts (4.3 g/100 g), while sweetened dairy and dairy alternative beverages had the smallest percentage of added sugars (65.6\% of total sugars; 33.8\% of calories). Estimation validity was determined by comparing LP estimated values to NFL values, as well as in a small validation study. LP estimates appeared reasonable compared to NFL values for calories, carbohydrates and total sugars, and performed well in the validation test; however, further work is needed to obtain more definitive conclusions on the accuracy of added sugar estimates in CPGs. As nutrition labeling regulations evolve, this approach can be adapted to test for potential product-specific, category-level, and population-level implications.},

  abstract = {Variation in state cigarette taxes provides incentives for tax avoidance through smuggling, legal border crossing to low tax jurisdictions, or Internet purchasing. When taxes rise, tax paid sales of cigarettes will decline both because consumption will decrease and because tax avoidance will increase. The key innovation of this paper is to compare cigarette sales data to cigarette consumption data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). I show that after subtracting percent changes in consumption, residual percent changes in sales are associated with state cigarette tax changes implying the existence of tax avoidance. I estimate that the tax avoidance response to tax changes is at least twice the consumption response and that tax avoidance accounted for up to 9.6\% of sales between 1985 and 2001. Because of the increase in tax avoidance, tax paid sales data understate the level of smoking and overstate the drop in smoking. I also find that the level of legal border crossing was very low relative to other forms of tax avoidance. If states have strong preferences for smoking control, they must pair high cigarette taxes with effective policies to curb smuggling and other forms of tax avoidance or employ alternative policies such as counter-advertising and smoking restrictions.},

For each modeled diet, total departure from an observed French population's average food group pattern ({\textquotedblleft}mean observed diet{\textquotedblright}) was minimized.
To achieve the nutritional recommendations without a cost constraint, the modeled diet provided more energy from fish, fresh fruits and green vegetables and less energy from animal fats and cheese than the {\textquotedblleft}mean observed diet.{\textquotedblright} Introducing and strengthening a cost constraint decreased the energy provided by meat, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, vegetable fat, and yogurts and increased the energy from processed meat, eggs, offal, and milk. For the lowest cost diet (ie, {\mbox{\texteuro}}3.18/d), marked changes from the {\textquotedblleft}mean observed diet{\textquotedblright} were required, including a marked reduction in the amount of energy from fresh fruits (-85\%) and green vegetables (-70\%), and an increase in the amount of energy from nuts, dried fruits, roots, legumes, and fruit juices.
Nutrition education for low-income French women must emphasize these affordable food choices.},

  abstract = {Background
Previous research indicates that few Americans meet the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption, and that adequate fruit and vegetable consumption may decrease the risk for chronic disease.
Methods
Twenty-four-hour dietary recall data from NHANES III, 1988{\textendash}1994 (n=14,997) and NHANES 1999{\textendash}2002 (n=8910) were used to assess adult (equal to or more than 18 years) trends in daily fruit and vegetable consumption (number of servings and types).
Results
In 1988{\textendash}1994, an estimated 27\% of adults met the USDA guidelines for fruit (equal to or more than two servings) and 35\% met the guidelines for vegetables (equal to or more than three servings). In 1999{\textendash}2002, 28\% and 32\% of adults met fruit and vegetable guidelines, respectively. There was a significant decrease in vegetable consumption over time (p=0.026). Only 11\% met USDA guidelines for both fruits and vegetables in 1988{\textendash}1994 and 1999{\textendash}2002, indicating no change in consumption (p=0.963). In both data sets, non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to meet USDA guidelines compared to non-Hispanic whites (p\ensuremath{<}0.05). Higher income and greater education were significantly associated with meeting the guidelines in both data sets (p\ensuremath{<}0.05).
Conclusions
Despite the initiation of a national fruit and vegetable campaign in 1991, the findings indicated that Americans' fruit and vegetable consumption did not increase in 1999{\textendash}2002, and only a small proportion met the related dietary recommendations. Greater public health efforts and approaches are needed to promote healthy eating in the United States.},

A revenue-neutral tax harmonization leads to aggregate real-GDP and welfare gains of 0.7\%. Tax cuts by individual states lower own-state tax revenues and economic activity, and generate cross-state spillovers depending on trade linkages.},

The framework allows for a continuum of target parameters and for Lasso-type or Post-Lasso type methods to be used as estimators of a continuum of high-dimensional nuisance functions. As an important leading example of this environment, we first provide results on estimation and inference for relevant treatment effects, such as local average and quantile treatment effects. The setting is designed expressly to handle many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. An approximate sparsity condition permits estimation and inference to proceed after data-driven selection of control variables. We provide conditions under which post-selection inference is uniformly valid across a wide-range of models and show that a key condition underlying the uniform validity of post-selection inference allowing for imperfect model selection is the use of orthogonal moment conditions. We apply the methods to estimate the effect of 401(k) participation on accumulated assets. We also generalize the results from the treatment effects setting to accommodate more general moment condition models. We establish functional central limit theorems for the continuum of target parameters and for the multiplier bootstrap that holds uniformly over dgps. We propose a notion of the functional delta method that allows us to derive approximate distributions for smooth functionals of a continuum of target parameters and to establish the validity of the multiplier bootstrap for approximating these distributions uniformly over dgps. We also establish rate results for continua of Lasso type estimators for continua of regression functions.},

To evaluate whether sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, a significant source of dietary fructose, is associated with higher serum uric acid levels and blood pressure in adolescents.
Study design
We analyzed cross-sectional data from 4867 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2004. Dietary data were assessed from 24-hour dietary recall interviews. Sugar-sweetened beverages included fruit drinks, sports drinks, soda, and sweetened coffee or tea. We used multivariate linear regression to evaluate the association of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption with serum uric acid and with blood pressure.
Results
Adolescents who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages tended to be older and male. In the adjusted model, serum uric acid increased by 0.18 mg/dL and systolic blood pressure z-score increased by 0.17 from the lowest to the highest category of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (P for trend, .01 and .03, respectively).
Conclusions
These results from a nationally representative sample of US adolescents indicate that higher sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with higher serum uric acid levels and systolic blood pressure, which may lead to downstream adverse health outcomes.},

We then develop a simple framework that allows us to characterize analytically how within-group income inequality affects consumption inequality in a world in which agents can trade a full set of contingent consumption claims, subject to endogenous constraints emanating from the limited enforcement of intertemporal contracts. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate, in the context of a calibrated general equilibrium production economy, whether this set-up, or alternatively a standard incomplete markets model, can account for the documented stylized consumption inequality facts from the U.S. data.},

  abstract = {Objective To systematically review evidence from field interventions on the effectiveness of monetary subsidies in promoting healthier food purchases and consumption. Design Keyword and reference searches were conducted in five electronic databases: Cochrane Library, EconLit, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Studies were included based on the following criteria: (i) intervention: field experiments; (ii) population: adolescents 12{\textendash}17 years old or adults 18 years and older; (iii) design: randomized controlled trials, cohort studies or pre{\textendash}post studies; (iv) subsidy: price discounts or vouchers for healthier foods; (v) outcome: food purchases or consumption; (vi) period: 1990{\textendash}2012; and (vii) language: English. Twenty-four articles on twenty distinct experiments were included with study quality assessed using predefined methodological criteria. Setting Interventions were conducted in seven countries: the USA (n 14), Canada (n 1), France (n 1), Germany (n 1), Netherlands (n 1), South Africa (n 1) and the UK (n 1). Subsidies applied to different types of foods such as fruits, vegetables and low-fat snacks sold in supermarkets, cafeterias, vending machines, farmers' markets or restaurants. Subjects Interventions enrolled various population subgroups such as school/university students, metropolitan transit workers and low-income women. Results All but one study found subsidies on healthier foods to significantly increase the purchase and consumption of promoted products. Study limitations include small and convenience samples, short intervention and follow-up duration, and lack of cost-effectiveness and overall diet assessment. Conclusions Subsidizing healthier foods tends to be effective in modifying dietary behaviour. Future studies should examine its long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness at the population level and its impact on overall diet intake.},

Capping added-sugar emissions into the food supply by food manufacturers at a rate of 1\% per year would be expected to reduce the prevalence of obesity by 1.7 percentage points (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.9, 2.4; a 4.6\% decline) and the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 21.7 cases per 100 000 people (95\% CI = 12.9, 30.6; a 4.2\% decline) over 20 years, averting approximately {\textdollar}9.7 billion in health care spending. Racial and ethnic minorities would be expected to experience the largest declines. By comparison, equivalent price penalties through excise taxes would be expected to generate smaller health benefits.

The main result is that the Pigovian principle holds in a modified form in the latter case as well. The problem of the distributional impact of taxation is also studied for the special case of individuals with identical preferences and a utilitarian social welfare function.},

  abstract = {A recent "revisionist" literature characterizes the pronounced rise in U.S. wage inequality since 1980 as an "episodic" event of the first half of the 1980s driven by nonmarket factors (particularly a falling real minimum wage) and concludes that continued increases in wage inequality since the late 1980s substantially reflect the mechanical confounding effects of changes in labor force composition. Analyzing data from the Current Population Survey for 1963 to 2005, we find limited support for these claims. The slowing of the growth of overall wage inequality in the 1990s hides a divergence in the paths of upper-tail (90/50) inequality--which has increased steadily since 1980, even adjusting for changes in labor force composition--and lower-tail (50/10) inequality, which rose sharply in the first half of the 1980s and plateaued or contracted thereafter. Fluctuations in the real minimum wage are not a plausible explanation for these trends since the bulk of inequality growth occurs above the median of the wage distribution. Models emphasizing rapid secular growth in the relative demand for skills--attributable to skill-biased technical change--and a sharp deceleration in the relative supply of college workers in the 1980s do an excellent job of capturing the evolution of the college/high school wage premium over four decades. But these models also imply a puzzling deceleration in relative demand growth for college workers in the early 1990s, also visible in a recent "polarization" of skill demands in which employment has expanded in high-wage and low-wage work at the expense of middle-wage jobs. These patterns are potentially reconciled by a modified version of the skill-biased technical change hypothesis that emphasizes the role of information technology in complementing abstract (high-education) tasks and substituting for routine (middle-education) tasks.},

Consumer items like food are often afforded preferential treatment, and business purchases like manufacturing machinery are exempt in some states. There is no research that explores these and other sales tax base choices. This article provides an empirical examination of sales tax base choice on the part of states using a political economy framework and tools of spatial econometrics. The analysis accommodates tax competition among states, using a variety of alternative definitions of "competitors." The authors find little evidence that consumer exemptions are linked to needy segments of the population, while equipment exemptions are more common in states with large industrial sectors. The results also show that the nature of the interstate tax competition process differs for different elements of the base and that nongeographic competition can be especially important.},

The results are also extended to two-step estimators (with finite-dimensional parameter estimation in the first step), estimators derived from nonsmooth objective functions, and semiparametric two-step estimators (with nonparametric estimation of an infinite-dimensional parameter in the first step). Finally, the trinity of test statistics is considered within the quite general setting of GMM estimation, and numerous examples are given.},

Using product- specific nutritional information, we develop a new method of partitioning the product space into relevant nutritional clusters that define a set of nutritionally-bundled goods, which parsimoniously characterize consumer choice sets. We then estimate a large utility-derived demand system over this joint product-nutrient space that allows us to calculate price and expenditure elasticities. Using our structural demand estimates, we simulate the role of product taxes on soda, sugar-sweetened beverages, packaged meals, and snacks, and nutrient taxes on fat, salt, and sugar. We find that a 20\% nutrient tax has a significantly larger impact on nutrition than an equivalent product tax, due to the fact that these are broader-based taxes. However, the costs of these taxes in terms of consumer utility are not higher. A sugar tax in particular is a powerful tool to induce healthier nutritive bundles among consumers.},

  abstract = {In modern societies it seems that the pleasures of taste often encourage the consumption of fatty, salty and sweet foods, whereas growing health awareness discourages consumption of the same foods. Numerous studies find that education and diet healthiness are highly correlated and one possible explanation is that consumers with a longer education are better at understanding and appreciating the health implication of their diet than are consumers with a short education. In this study we estimate a hedonic model of consumer's valuation of food characteristics that allows nutrients to influence utility both through their perceived effects on health and their effects on the taste of food. The model is estimated using purchase data from a consumer panel with comprehensive coverage of food purchases for 2500 Danish households. We find that it is differences in taste valuations, rather than differences in valuation of health effects, that explains the observed differences in dietary healthiness across consumers with different educational backgrounds.},

  abstract = {Poor dietary patterns and obesity, established risk factors for chronic disease, have been linked to neighborhood deprivation, neighborhood minority composition, and low area population density. Neighborhood differences in access to food may have an important influence on these relationships and health disparities in the U.S. This article reviews research relating to the presence, nature, and implications of neighborhood differences in access to food.
A snowball strategy was used to identify relevant research studies (n=54) completed in the U.S. and published between 1985 and April 2008.
Research suggests that neighborhood residents who have better access to supermarkets and limited access to convenience stores tend to have healthier diets and lower levels of obesity. Results from studies examining the accessibility of restaurants are less consistent, but there is some evidence to suggest that residents with limited access to fast-food restaurants have healthier diets and lower levels of obesity. National and local studies across the U.S. suggest that residents of low-income, minority, and rural neighborhoods are most often affected by poor access to supermarkets and healthful food. In contrast, the availability of fast-food restaurants and energy-dense foods has been found to be greater in lower-income and minority neighborhoods.
Neighborhood disparities in access to food are of great concern because of their potential to influence dietary intake and obesity. Additional research is needed to address various limitations of current studies, identify effective policy actions, and evaluate intervention strategies designed to promote more equitable access to healthy foods.},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, I investigate the relationship between unemployment and grocery purchasing patterns with a particular focus on the health impacts of recession. The first chapter, I analyze food items and in the second chapter, I turn the focus on beer and cigarettes. Both of these chapters investigate possible mechanisms behind the documented phenomenon of decreased morbidity and mortality during recessions.To conduct the analysis presented in Chapter 1, I supplement five years of multi-market, multi-chain grocery scanner data with additional information on the positive health attributes of food products to create a unique dataset. First, I find no evidence that products with positive health attributes are systematically more expensive or promoted systematically less. They are, however, purchased on promotion less. Second, I match the scanner data with unemployment rate by market in order to conduct a reduced form analysis of changes in pricing, promotion and quantities sold given a macroeconomic shock. For overall grocery categories, prices go down, promotions weakly increase and overall quantities sold decline; results vary for products with health attributes. While shares for healthy products within category are unaffected by recession in some categories, in other categories I see a marked shift toward higher fat options within category.In Chapter 2, I again use retail scanner data to track price and quantity changes for beer and cigarettes subject to changes in unemployment rate. First, I find prices paid do not change significantly as a function of unemployment rate. Next, I find that the percentage of beer and cigarettes purchased on promotion is not significantly related to unemployment rate per se; that said, there is evidence of a period of experimentation with in-store cigarette promotions following the Tobacco Master Agreement that coincided with the 2001 recession and led to more cigarettes being purchased on promotion overall during that period. However, this period of strong in-store promotions gave way to fewer overall purchases made on promotion as states strengthened tobacco regulations in the early 2000's. The quantity of beer sold in supermarkets, which accounts for about 40 percent of total beer sales, and drug stores seems mostly unchanged by recessionary conditions; however, cigarette quantity sold has a modest negative relationship with unemployment. Taken as a whole, this work suggests that average grocery purchasing patterns do not change greatly due to increases in average unemployment rate. While not entirely inconsistent with the hypothesis that decreased morbidity and mortality during recessions may be due to decreased smoking rates or better eating habits, the small magnitude of the overall effect suggests other mechanisms or heterogeneous effects might be at play.},

Understanding the recent patterns and trends in beverage intake and sales in Mexico provides both background and baseline data for the importance of SSBs and other beverages in the Mexican diet. We analyzed a single 24-h dietary recall from 2 nationally representative surveys: the Mexican Nutrition Survey 1999 (n = 6049) and the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 (n = 10,343). To describe trends and patterns in beverages, we calculated the volume and energy intake per capita and per consumer and the proportion of consumers of each beverage group in each survey. A commercial sales dataset was used to describe beverage sales trends from 1999 to 2012. From 1999 to 2012, total daily energy from beverages increased among children aged 5{\textendash}11 y (+45.3 kcal), females aged 12{\textendash}19 y (+57.3 kcal), and adult females aged 20{\textendash}49 y (+96.4 kcal) (P \ensuremath{<} 0.05). Over the same period, intake of beverages with added sugars increased, specifically flavored milk, agua fresca (fruit water made in stalls or at home, usually with added sugars), and fruit drinks among children aged 5{\textendash}11 y and females aged 12{\textendash}19 y and caloric coffee/tea, soda, and agua fresca among adult females aged 20{\textendash}49 y. In 2012, beverages represented 17.5\% (325 kcal) and 19.0\% (382 kcal) of the total daily energy intake per capita in children aged 1{\textendash}19 y and adults aged \ensuremath{\geq}20 y, respectively. In 2012, flavored milk beverages, caloric soda, and high-fat milk were the top 3 major contributors to total daily energy intake per capita in all children aged 1{\textendash}19 y. Caloric soda, caloric coffee/tea, and agua fresca were the top 3 major energy contributors in adults aged \ensuremath{\geq}20 y. From 1999 to 2012, sales of soda, fruit-flavored drinks, and flavored waters increased. In conclusion, consumption of several beverages with added sugars increased among children and adult females in Mexico. Because caloric soda is currently 1 of the top beverages consumed, a 10\% tax on SSBs might help to significantly reduce added sugars intake in Mexico.},

Epidemiologic studies have suggested that higher intake of added sugar is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Few prospective studies have examined the association of added sugar intake with CVD mortality.Objective
To examine time trends of added sugar consumption as percentage of daily calories in the United States and investigate the association of this consumption with CVD mortality.Design, Setting, and Participants
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 1988-1994 {[}III], 1999-2004, and 2005-2010 {[}n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}31\hspace{0.167em}147]) for the time trend analysis and NHANES III Linked Mortality cohort (1988-2006 {[}n\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}11\hspace{0.167em}733]), a prospective cohort of a nationally representative sample of US adults for the association study.Main Outcomes and Measures
Cardiovascular disease mortality.Results
Among US adults, the adjusted mean percentage of daily calories from added sugar increased from 15.7\% (95\% CI, 15.0\%-16.4\%) in 1988-1994 to 16.8\% (16.0\%-17.7\%; P\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}.02) in 1999-2004 and decreased to 14.9\% (14.2\%-15.5\%; P\hspace{0.167em}\ensuremath{<}\hspace{0.167em}.001) in 2005-2010. Most adults consumed 10\% or more of calories from added sugar (71.4\%) and approximately 10\% consumed 25\% or more in 2005-2010. During a median follow-up period of 14.6 years, we documented 831 CVD deaths during 163\hspace{0.167em}039 person-years. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity{\textendash}adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of CVD mortality across quintiles of the percentage of daily calories consumed from added sugar were 1.00 (reference), 1.09 (95\% CI, 1.05-1.13), 1.23 (1.12-1.34), 1.49 (1.24-1.78), and 2.43 (1.63-3.62; P\hspace{0.167em}\ensuremath{<}\hspace{0.167em}.001), respectively. After additional adjustment for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics, HRs were 1.00 (reference), 1.07 (1.02-1.12), 1.18 (1.06-1.31), 1.38 (1.11-1.70), and 2.03 (1.26-3.27; P\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}.004), respectively. Adjusted HRs were 1.30 (95\% CI, 1.09-1.55) and 2.75 (1.40-5.42; P\hspace{0.167em}=\hspace{0.167em}.004), respectively, comparing participants who consumed 10.0\% to 24.9\% or 25.0\% or more calories from added sugar with those who consumed less than 10.0\% of calories from added sugar. These findings were largely consistent across age group, sex, race/ethnicity (except among non-Hispanic blacks), educational attainment, physical activity, health eating index, and body mass index.Conclusions and Relevance
Most US adults consume more added sugar than is recommended for a healthy diet. We observed a significant relationship between added sugar consumption and increased risk for CVD mortality.},

We develop an extension of the standard formula for the optimal Pigouvian corrective tax to incorporate the possibility that consumers avoid the tax by making purchases in nearby lower tax jurisdictions. To provide a key parameter for our formula, we estimate a structural endogenous switching regression model of border-crossing and cigarette prices. In illustrative calculations, we find that for many states, after taking into account tax avoidance the optimal tax is at least 20\% smaller than the standard Pigouvian tax that simply internalizes external costs. Our empirical estimate that tax avoidance strongly responds to the price differential is the main reason for this result. We also use our results to examine the benefits of replacing avoidable state excise taxes with a harder-to-avoid federal excise tax on cigarettes.},

Following legislation enacted in March 2009, an ex post analysis of demand is possible to evaluate relative costs and benefits of MCOOL. This study uses retail grocery-store scanner data to estimate a Rotterdam demand model of meat products. The model results failed to detect changes in consumer meat demand post-MCOOL. Given the costs of compliance incurred by meat processors and no evidence of increased demand, our results suggest that producers and consumers have experienced a welfare loss.},

  shorttitle = {Committing to {{Exercise}}},
  abstract = {Sedentary lifestyles, obesity, and obesity-related chronic diseases have become increasingly common among U.S. adults, posing a major health policy challenge. While individuals may be interested in exercising more to reduce these health risks, they often have difficultly forming long-term exercise habits. Behavioral economic devices like commitment contracts aid individuals make repeated actions in situations where there are upfront costs and the benefits, though substantial, are delayed. It is not known whether such contracts can help individuals to sustain increased exercise. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test whether nudges and anchoring could be used to shift the types of exercise commitment contracts people entered into using a web-based contract creation tool. At the time of contract creation, users selected a contract length (duration); number of times a week to exercise (frequency); and a financial penalty for failing to live up to the contract in a given week (stake). We randomly set the default duration shown to users (8 weeks, 12 weeks, or 16 weeks). Outcomes include: contract acceptance; chosen duration, frequency, total exercise sessions; and chosen financial stake. We analyzed the data using multivariable regressions and also developed a theoretical model of active choice in the context of nudges, fitting the model to the data using non-linear optimization. 619 users, age 18-69, were included in the study, of whom 61\% accepted/signed an exercise commitment contract. Users who were shown a longer default contract durations were significantly more likely to choose a contract of longer duration. There was no difference in the likelihood of accepting contracts or in the chosen exercise frequency or financial stakes. Our model of active choice suggested that almost 50\% of users were highly susceptible to default values for contract duration, with the greatest effect for users interested in exercise contracts with durations nearer to the nudged defaults. This implication of the model was confirmed by quantile regressions (greatest effect of nudges for contract durations between the 40th and 80th percentiles). With changes in default values, individuals can be nudged into longer exercise commitment contracts that obligate them to greater numbers of exercise sessions.},

The IV model, which exploits genetic variation in weight as a natural experiment, yields estimates of the impact of obesity on medical costs that are considerably higher than the estimates reported in the previous literature. For example, obesity is associated with {\textdollar}656 higher annual medical care costs, but the IV results indicate that obesity raises annual medical costs by {\textdollar}2741 (in 2005 dollars). These results imply that the previous literature has underestimated the medical costs of obesity, resulting in underestimates of the economic rationale for government intervention to reduce obesity-related externalities.},

This study assesses its effectiveness in a range of settings. Methods\hspace{0.6em} Systematic review of peer reviewed intervention trials and grey literature evaluation reports of child malnutrition programs using the Positive Deviance/Hearth approach. Results\hspace{0.6em} Ten peer reviewed studies and 14 grey literature reports met the inclusion criteria. These described results for 17 unique Positive Deviance/Hearth programs in 12 countries. Nine programs used a pre- and post-test design without a control, which limited the conclusions that could be drawn. Eight used more robust designs such as non-randomized trials, non-randomized cross-sectional sibling studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of the eight programs that reported nutritional outcomes, five reported some type of positive result in terms of nutritional status {\textendash} although the improvement was not always as large as predicted, or across the entire target population. Both the two RCTs demonstrated improvements in carer feeding practices. Qualitative results unanimously reported high levels of satisfaction from participants and recipient communities. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Overall this study shows mixed results in terms of program effectiveness, although some Positive Deviance/Hearth programs have clearly been successful in particular settings. Sibling studies suggest that the Positive Deviance/Hearth approach may have a role in preventing malnutrition, not just rehabilitation. Further research is needed using more robust study designs and larger sample sizes. Issues related to community participation and consistency in reporting results need to be addressed.},

To consider the hypothesis that addiction to food, or more specifically sucrose, plays a role in obesity and eating disorders.
Methods
By considering the relevant literature a series of predictions were examined, derived from the hypothesis that addiction to sucrose consumption can develop. Fasting should increase food cravings, predominantly for sweet items; cravings should occur after an overnight fast; the obese should find sweetness particularly attractive; a high-sugar consumption should predispose to obesity. More specifically predictions based on the hypothesis that addiction to sugar is central to bingeing disorders were developed. Dieting should predate the development of bingeing; dietary style rather than psychological, social and economic factors should be predispose to eating disorders; sweet items should be preferentially consumed while bingeing; opioid antagonists should cause withdrawal symptoms; bingeing should develop at a younger age when there is a greater preference for sweetness.
Results
The above predications have in common that on no occasion was the behaviour predicted by an animal model of sucrose addiction supported by human studies.
Conclusion
There is no support from the human literature for the hypothesis that sucrose may be physically addictive or that addiction to sugar plays a role in eating disorders.},

There is no indication that simple sugars differ from complex sugars in this regard. Epidemiologic data show a clear inverse relation between intake of sugar and fat. Further, although high intake of dietary fat is positively associated with indexes of obesity, high intake of sugar is negatively associated with indexes of obesity. There is ample reason to associate high-fat diets with obesity but, at present, no reason to associate high-sugar diets with obesity.},

  volume = {1, Part B},
  abstract = {While the tobacco industry ranks among the most substantial and successful of economic enterprises, tobacco consumption is associated with more deaths than any other product. Economic analysis of the markets for tobacco products, particularly cigarettes, has contributed considerable insight to debates about the importance of the industry and the appropriate roles of public policy in grappling with the health consequences of tobacco. Certainly the most significant example of this phenomenon has been the rapidly expanding and increasingly sophisticated body of research on the effects of price increases on cigarette consumption. Because excise tax comprises an important component of price, the resultant literature has played a prominent role in legislative debates about using taxation as a principal tool to discourage smoking. In addition to informing legislative debates, this literature has contributed both theory and empirical evidence to the growing interest in modeling the demand for addictive products.

This chapter examines this body of research in detail, as well as a variety of equity and efficiency concerns accompanying debates about cigarette taxation. Coverage also includes economic analysis of the role of other tobacco control policies, such as restrictions on advertising, of special interest due to their prominence in debates about tobacco control. The chapter concludes with consideration of research addressing the validity of the tobacco industry's argument that its contributions to employment, tax revenues, and trade balances are vital to the economic health of states and nations. This argument is one of the industry's principal weapons in its battle against policy measures intended to reduce tobacco product consumption.},

  abstract = {The obesity epidemic and excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages have led to proposals of economics-based interventions to promote healthy eating in the United States. Targeted food and beverage taxes and subsidies are prominent examples of such potential intervention strategies. This paper examines the differential effects that taxing sugar-sweetened beverages by calories and by ounces have on beverage demand. To properly measure the extent of substitution and complementarity between beverage products, we developed a fully modified distance metric model of differentiated product demand that endogenizes the cross-price effects. We illustrated the proposed methodology in a linear approximate almost ideal demand system, although other flexible demand systems can also be used. In the empirical application using supermarket scanner data, the product-level demand model consists of 178 beverage products with a combined market share of over 90\%. The novel demand model outperformed the conventional distance metric model in non-nested model comparison tests, and in terms of the economic significance of model predictions. In the fully modified model, a calorie-based beverage tax was estimated to cost {\textdollar}1.40 less in compensating variation than an ounce-based tax per 3,500 beverage calories reduced. This difference in welfare cost estimates between two tax strategies is more than three times the difference estimated by the conventional distance metric model. If applied to products purchased from all sources, a 0.04-cent per kcal tax on sugar-sweetened beverages is predicted to reduce annual per capita beverage intake by 5,800 kcal.},

In addition, consumer nutrition label use increases average daily fiber intake by 7.51 grams.},

Our estimates indicate that food sales fell in West Virginia border counties by about eight percent as a result of the imposition of the six percent sales tax on food at the beginning of 1990.},

Economic interventions like taxes can shift the relative prices of unhealthy foods to nudge consumers towards healthier options. Beverages with added sugar are a good starting point for food taxation; they constitute over 10 percent of caloric intake nationwide and provide little or no nutritional value. Current levels of taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are too low to affect consumer behavior, but the implementation of a penny-per-ounce excise tax could lead to substantial public health benefits. Current estimates predict that a tax that raised the cost of SSBs by 20 percent could lead to an average reduction of 3.8 pounds per year for adults, causing the prevalence of obesity to decline from 33 to 30 percent. SSB taxes would also generate considerable revenue for public health and obesity prevention programs. Although the beverage industry is fighting such taxes with massive lobbying and public relations campaigns, support for the policies is increasing, especially when revenue is earmarked for obesity prevention.},

The study adopts a state-level panel data series spanning the period 2002 through 2007, which is the most recent panel for which data for all of the variables are available. Consistent with a number of previous studies, the PLS estimates in this study find that the higher the cigarette excise tax, the lower the aggregate volume of cigarettes consumed. Of course, this outcome does not address the practical problem of the substitution of high nicotine cigarettes for low nicotine cigarettes in the presence of a significant cigarette tax hike. This circumstance leads to the second objective of this study, namely, to propose a general template for a different kind of cigarette excise tax, one that is tied directly to each cigarette brand's nicotine and tar content.},

During the past two decades, the prevalence of obesity in children has risen greatly worldwide. Obesity in childhood causes a wide range of serious complications, and increases the risk of premature illness and death later in life, raising public-health concerns. Results of research have provided new insights into the physiological basis of bodyweight regulation. However, treatment for childhood obesity remains largely ineffective. In view of its rapid development in genetically stable populations, the childhood obesity epidemic can be primarily attributed to adverse environmental factors for which straightforward, if politically difficult, solutions exist.},

This new evidence on the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and poverty is of particular interest given recent changes in anti-poverty policies that have placed greater emphasis on participation in the labor market and in-kind transfers. We look beyond official poverty, examining alternative income poverty and consumption poverty, which have conceptual and empirical advantages as measures of the well-being of the poor. We find that both income and consumption poverty are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. A one percentage point increase in unemployment is associated with an increase in the after-tax income poverty rate of 0.9 to 1.1 percentage points in the long-run, and an increase in the consumption poverty rate of 0.3 to 1.2 percentage points in the long-run. The evidence on whether income is more responsive to the business cycle than consumption is mixed. Income poverty does appear to be more responsive using national level variation, but consumption poverty is often more responsive to unemployment when using regional variation. Low percentiles of both income and consumption are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, and in most cases low percentiles of income appear to be more responsive than low percentiles of consumption.},

  abstract = {As the largest federal food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has potential to improve food choices among low-income populations. The program's impact on youth is important because they are represented in more than half of all SNAP households. This study estimates the impact of participation in SNAP, also known as the Food Stamp Program, on the frequency of soft drink, 100\% fruit juice, and milk consumption among youth (ages 11 through 14) in the United States. A cohort of 3,126 youth from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey who were surveyed in 2004 (5th grade) and 2007 (8th grade) were used for the analysis. Multivariate linear regression with individual fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect of SNAP participation on the frequency of consumption of each beverage type in the preceding week. The fixed effects controlled for factors specific to the youth, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and time-invariant bias in reporting SNAP participation or beverage consumption. Overall participation in SNAP increased from 19.5\% to 20.3\% between 2004 and 2007, with 14.4\% reporting a different participation status in 2007 as compared with 2004. SNAP participation was not found to be predictive of the frequency of soft drink, 100\% fruit juice, or milk consumption among youth. In its current state, SNAP may serve to replace lost income for qualifying households, but not alter their food and beverage choices. Interventions that support access to and incentivize the consumption of more healthful foods and beverages may be successful in improving the nutritional quality of intake.},

  shorttitle = {Taxes on {{Sugar-Sweetened Beverages}}},
  doi = {10.1016/j.amepre.2012.09.065},
  abstract = {Background
Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages including nondiet sodas, sport drinks, and energy drinks has been linked with obesity. Recent state and local efforts to tax these beverages have been unsuccessful. Enactment will be unlikely without public support, yet little research is available to assess how to effectively make the case for such taxes.
Purpose
The objectives were to assess public opinion about arguments used commonly in tax debates regarding sugar-sweetened beverages and to assess differences in public opinion by respondents' political party affiliation.
Methods
A public opinion survey was fielded in January{\textendash}March 2011 using a probability-based sample of respondents from a large, nationally representative online panel to examine public attitudes about nine pro- and eight anti-tax arguments. These data were analyzed in August 2011.
Results
Findings indicated greater public agreement with anti- than pro-tax arguments. The most popular anti-tax argument was that a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages is arbitrary because it does not affect consumption of other unhealthy foods (60\%). A majority also agreed that such taxes were a quick way for politicians to fill budget holes (58\%); an unacceptable intrusion of government into people's lives (53.8\%); opposed by most Americans (53\%); and harmful to the poor (51\%). No pro-tax arguments were endorsed by a majority of the public. Respondents reported highest agreement with the argument that sugar-sweetened beverages were the single largest contributor to obesity (49\%) and would raise revenue for obesity prevention (41\%).
Conclusions
Without bolstering public support for existing pro-tax messages or developing alternative pro-tax messages, enacting such policies will be difficult. Message-framing studies could be useful in identifying promising strategies for persuading Americans that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages are warranted.},

  abstract = {Weight loss resulting from an exercise intervention tends to be lower than predicted. Modest weight loss can arise from an increase in energy intake, physiological reductions in resting energy expenditure, an increase in lean tissue or a decrease in non-exercise activity. Lower than expected, weight loss could also arise from weak and invalidated assumptions within predictive models. To investigate these causes, we systematically reviewed studies that monitored compliance to exercise prescriptions and measured exercise-induced change in body composition. Changed body energy stores were calculated to determine the deficit between total daily energy intake and energy expenditures. This information combined with available measurements was used to critically evaluate explanations for low exercise-induced weight loss. We conclude that the small magnitude of weight loss observed from the majority of evaluated exercise interventions is primarily due to low doses of prescribed exercise energy expenditures compounded by a concomitant increase in caloric intake.},

Forty percent of Berkeley High freshmen are overweight or obese, according to the city's most recent public health survey.

Using individual data on food purchases from a representative survey of 19,000 French households in 2005, we estimate consumer demand using a random utility approach. Among a set of possible vertical relationships, we select the model that best fits the data. We evaluate the pass-through rate of changes in input costs (sugar) or of taxes and show that the industry over-shifts cost changes or excise taxes to the consumers. This result challenges the belief that firms do not pass on the full extent of cost changes or excise taxes to consumers.},

This paper demonstrates, that this comes at the "price" of several unusual implications. For example, we calculate that a society of agents with the preferences and endowment process of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) would experience a welfare gain equivalent to a permanent increase of nearly 16\% in consumption, if the government enforced one month of fasting per year, reducing consumption by 10 percent then. We examine and explain these features of the preferences in detail. We numerically characterize the solution to the social planning problem. We conclude that Campbell-Cochrance preferences will provide for interesting macroeconomic modeling challenges, when endogenizing aggregate consumption choices and government policy.},

  abstract = {Data with a large number of variables relative to the sample size{\textemdash}"high-dimensional data"{\textemdash}are readily available and increasingly common in empirical economics. High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in "data mining" can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term "data mining" in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for "true" predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jhealeco.2007.05.005},
  abstract = {Virtually all social science research related to obesity studies a person's body mass index (BMI). Yet there is wide agreement in the medical literature that BMI is seriously flawed because it does not distinguish fat from fat-free mass such as muscle and bone. This paper studies data that include multiple measures of fatness and finds that many important patterns, such as who is classified as obese, group rates of obesity, and correlations of obesity with social science outcomes, are all sensitive to the measure of fatness and obesity used.
We show that, relative to percent body fat, BMI misclassifies substantial fractions of individuals as obese or non-obese; in general, BMI is less accurate classifying men than women. Furthermore, when percent body fat instead of BMI is used to define obesity, the gap in obesity between white and African American men increases substantially but the gap in obesity between African American and white women is cut in half. Finally, total body fat is negatively correlated with employment for some groups and fat-free mass is not significantly correlated with employment for any group, a difference that was obscured in previous research that studied BMI.
In the long run, social science datasets should include more accurate measures of fatness. In the short run, estimating more accurate measures of fatness using height and weight is not possible except by making unattractive assumptions, but there is also no reason to adhere uncritically to BMI as a measure of fatness. Social science research on obesity would be enriched by greater consideration of alternate specifications of weight and height and more accurate measures of fatness.},

Many prior studies have shown that general equilibrium interactions affect excess burden but have not appreciated the bias associated with ignoring these interactions or the quantitative importance of this bias. We derive an implementable alternative to the simple formula. This alternative formula captures interactions that the simple formula omits; as a result it is both unbiased and usually more accurate.},

  abstract = {Text data, including speeches, stories, and other document forms, are often connected to sentiment variables that are of interest for research in marketing, economics, and elsewhere. It is also very high dimensional and difficult to incorporate into statistical analyses. This article introduces a straightforward framework of sentiment-preserving dimension reduction for text data. Multinomial inverse regression is introduced as a general tool for simplifying predictor sets that can be represented as draws from a multinomial distribution, and we show that logistic regression of phrase counts onto document annotations can be used to obtain low dimension document representations that are rich in sentiment information. To facilitate this modeling, a novel estimation technique is developed for multinomial logistic regression with very high-dimension response. In particular, independent Laplace priors with unknown variance are assigned to each regression coefficient, and we detail an efficient routine for maximization of the joint posterior over coefficients and their prior scale. This "gamma-lasso" scheme yields stable and effective estimation for general high-dimension logistic regression, and we argue that it will be superior to current methods in many settings. Guidelines for prior specification are provided, algorithm convergence is detailed, and estimator properties are outlined from the perspective of the literature on non-concave likelihood penalization. Related work on sentiment analysis from statistics, econometrics, and machine learning is surveyed and connected. Finally, the methods are applied in two detailed examples and we provide out-of-sample prediction studies to illustrate their effectiveness.},

  title = {Demand {{Estimation}} with {{Machine Learning}} and {{Model Combination}}},
  abstract = {We survey and apply several techniques from the statistical and computer science literature to the problem of demand estimation. We derive novel asymptotic properties for several of these models. To improve out-of-sample prediction accuracy and obtain parametric rates of convergence, we propose a method of combining the underlying models via linear regression. Our method has several appealing features: it is robust to a large number of potentially-collinear regressors; it scales easily to very large data sets; the machine learning methods combine model selection and estimation; and the method can flexibly approximate arbitrary non-linear functions, even when the set of regressors is high dimensional and we also allow for fixed effects. We illustrate our method using a standard scanner panel data set to estimate promotional lift and find that our estimates are considerably more accurate in out of sample predictions of demand than some commonly used alternatives. While demand estimation is our motivating application, these methods are likely to be useful in other microeconometric problems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a model of consumer demand that is consistent with the observed expenditure patterns of individual consumers in a long time series of expenditure surveys and is also able to provide a detailed welfare analysis of shifts in relative prices. A nonparametric analysis of consumer expenditure patterns suggests that Engel curves require quadratic terms in the logarithm of expenditure. While popular models of demand such as the Translog or the Almost Ideal Demand Systems do allow flexible price responses within a theoretically coherent structure, they have expenditure share Engel curves that are linear in the logarithm of total expenditure. We derive the complete class of integrable quadratic logarithmic expenditure share systems. A specification from this class is estimated on a large pooled data set of U.K. households. Models that fail to account for Engel curvature are found to generate important distortions in the patterns of welfare losses associated with a tax increase.},

  abstract = {We consider the long-run patterns of poverty in the United States from the early 1960s to 2010. Our results contradict previous studies that have argued that poverty has shown little improvement over time or that antipoverty efforts have been ineffective. We find that moving from traditional income-based measures of poverty to a consumption-based measure and, crucially, adjusting for bias in price indexes lead to the conclusion that the poverty rate declined by 26.4 percentage points between 1960 and 2010, 8.5 percentage points of which has occurred since 1980. Our consumptionbased measure suggests considerably greater improvement than the incomebased measures for single-parent families and the elderly, but relatively less for married-parent families. Changes in tax policy explain a substantial part of the decline in poverty; Social Security has also been important, but other transfer programs have played a small role. Changes in education have also contributed, but other demographic trends have had little impact. Measurement error in income likely explains some of the most noticeable differences between changes in income poverty and in consumption poverty, but saving and dissaving appear to play a modest role for most demographic groups.},

  shorttitle = {Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain},
  abstract = {Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), particularly carbonated soft drinks, may be a key contributor to the epidemic of overweight and obesity, by virtue of these beverages' high added sugar content, low satiety, and incomplete compensation for total energy. Whether an association exists between SSB intake and weight gain is unclear. We searched English-language MEDLINE publications from 1966 through May 2005 for cross-sectional, prospective cohort, and experimental studies of the relation between SSBs and the risk of weight gain (ie, overweight, obesity, or both). Thirty publications (15 cross-sectional, 10 prospective, and 5 experimental) were selected on the basis of relevance and quality of design and methods. Findings from large cross-sectional studies, in conjunction with those from well-powered prospective cohort studies with long periods of follow-up, show a positive association between greater intakes of SSBs and weight gain and obesity in both children and adults. Findings from short-term feeding trials in adults also support an induction of positive energy balance and weight gain by intake of sugar-sweetened sodas, but these trials are few. A school-based intervention found significantly less soft-drink consumption and prevalence of obese and overweight children in the intervention group than in control subjects after 12 mo, and a recent 25-week randomized controlled trial in adolescents found further evidence linking SSB intake to body weight. The weight of epidemiologic and experimental evidence indicates that a greater consumption of SSBs is associated with weight gain and obesity. Although more research is needed, sufficient evidence exists for public health strategies to discourage consumption of sugary drinks as part of a healthy lifestyle.},

  abstract = {Money is usually a good motivator. When market actors buy or sell things that have unfortunate consequences for others -- negative externalities -- a standard economic prescription is to raise the price of the externality-producing good. Alternatively, the bad actor can be paid to stop. For policymakers, choosing between these two options, the stick and the carrot, can be a difficult task even if people respond as expected to cash incentives. David Gamage and Darien Shanske argue that low-salience taxes can be just as effective at changing behavior if policymakers increase their price to make up for the taxes' low visibility. Carrots are not necessarily always inferior to sticks, once salience and its potential correlations are taken into account. Fully salient price instruments may not always be ideal. Government should likely adjust the prices of its taxes and subsidies at least to account for the process of learning and diffusion of information across the economy. And these adjustments may be closer to optimal if they balance revenue and other needs against the correction of externalities.},

This paper proposes a semiparametric estimator that retains the computational advantage of the two-step approach but is immune to distributional misspecification. The key difference between the proposed estimator and the two-step estimator is that the parameters of the binary censoring equations are estimated using a distribution-free single-index model. We implement the proposed estimator using household-level data obtained from the Hainan province in China. specification test lends support to our approach.},
