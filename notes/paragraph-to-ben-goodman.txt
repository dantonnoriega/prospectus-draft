I would like to exploit the random assignment of the Durham Connects (DC) program to measure its long term impact on social service applications. The idea is to treat DC as an information treatment (e.g. a nurse contact to ask questions and provide assistance). My hypothesis is that participation in DC lowered the learning and barrier costs of low income families with children when applying for social services. That is, these families are better equipped to learn about, and navigate through, the universe of available services, should they need them. I expect to observe these families more often, not because they are in more need of assistance, but because they were made aware of these services and how to apply for them. 

Through Durham Social Services (DSS), I have access to when individuals come in to request services. I also have access to SNAP transfer and emergency assistance data. Through the SNAP data, I can identify families who have children born between July 2009 and December 2010, then work backwards to determine what other services the parents possibly requested. But a more complete way would be to use parents' names from short-term birth certificates---public record, to my understanding---for all children born in the 2 hospitals involved in DC. My understanding is that you have already collected these data. Accessing these data would greatly speed up the research process. I would still need to see if this passes IRB approval and to get permission from DSS to match their data against the DC data.
