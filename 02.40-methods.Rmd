## Methods {#methods-2 -}

Methods for this paper are greatly simplified by the fact that assignment to Durham Connects was *random*. This immediately provides an instrument where, by design, the exclusion restriction is true (always exogenous) to virtually any outcome variable of interest. For this study, I am interested Durham Social Services *applications*, which will serve as a proxy for take-up rate. Requesting (applying for) government assistance does not guarantee receipt of benefits. But it is a necessary step for any eligible individual/family to apply.

### A Simple Model of Social Service Demand {-}

A simple economic model helps illustrate how I believe the Durham Connects program may help increase take-up.

Assume all individuals equally value government benefits and incur the same costs when applying for benefits. Individuals, however, have different characteristics. These characteristics determine both eligibility and size of benefits. Let's also assume complete information, rationality, and that errors when applying are non-existent.

Individual $i$ with characteristics vector $\bm{x_i}$ will apply for government assistance only if the *net benefit* amount is greater than zero. That is,

$$
r_i  = \left \{ 
  \begin{array}{c} 
    1 \text{ if } NB(\bm{x_i}, c) > 0 \\ 
    0 \text{ if } NB(\bm{x_i}, c) \le 0 
  \end{array} \right.
$$

$$
  NB(\bm{x_i}) = B(\bm{x_i}) - c
$$

where $r_i$ is the decision to apply for benefits; $NB(\bm{x_i}, c)$ is the net benefit; $B(\bm{x_i})$ is the benefit amount as a function of individual characteristics, $\bm{x_i}$; and $c$ is the cost of applying. Eligible individuals have a value $B_i > 0$. Note that for convenience, $B_i \equiv B(\bm{x_i})$ and $NB(\bm{x_i}, c) \equiv NB_i$

My hypothesis is that the Durham Connects program reduces the cost of applying. In this simple model, assume that the DC program drops the cost of applying down to some $\tilde c < c$. Let $d_i = 1$ represent assignment to DC. Before assignment, each individual is eligible for net benefits

$$NB_i|_{d_i=1} = NB_{i1} = B_i - \tilde c$$
$$NB_i|_{d_i=0} = NB_{i0} = B_i - c$$

such that $NB_{i1} > NB_{i0}$ for all individuals. This implies,

$$P(r_i = 1|d_i = 1) \ge P(r_i=1|d_i = 0)$$

In words, if assignment to DC reduces the costs of applying, then the probability of applying for all individuals must either increase or stay the same. Under this framework, this would imply that there must exists a population of eligible individuals ($B_i > 0$) such that $NB_{i1} > 0$ but $NB_{i0} < 0$. All other individuals are either ineligible ($B_i \le 0$) or their application decision remain unchanged after assignment ($B_i > 0$ but $NB_{i1} > NB_{i0} > 0$ or $NB_{i0} < NB_{i1} \le 0$).

In reality, the cost of applying is also a function of (both observed and unobserved) individual characteristics. But the model, even with simple costs, still helps to illustrate why I believe the DC program may lead to higher observed counts within the treated group.

### Analytical Framework {-}

I plan to use the local average treatment effects (LATE) framework to measure changes in the timing and volume of applications to Durham Social Services [@angrist_mostly_2008]. I can be quite---but not totally---confident that, whatever the measured difference between the two subpopulations, it was driven solely by the *compliers*. I say "quite" because there are still some assumption that need to be made that would be costly to verify. I'll expand on this later in the section.

In this context, *compliers* are assigned to the treatment (Durham Connects) and, due to a *recommendation* or *referral* from a nurse home-visitor, apply for some eligible social service^[TK a percentage of who those who opted out would be great.]. *Never-takers* would be families that, despite any referral or recommendation, refuse to apply for social services and *always-takers* are families that would have applied for social services with or without assistance from Durham Connects. *Non-compliers* will be ignored; I find it highly unlikely that a family will, given assignment to Durham Connects, choose not to apply for social services, even when informed of eligibility.

I also want to distinguish between the *timing* and *volume* of applications. That an eligible family chooses to apply for a service would affect that family's application *volume*. But also important is the *timing* of the application. That a family applies earlier than they would have otherwise is important. As mentioned, hyperbolic discounting and status quo bias push humans to procrastinate. I could count the number of applications submitted within a fixed window (say, 2 years) between the two groups and find no differences. Lost in this comparison, however, would be the *timing* of the applications. That is, if the treated group happened to submit the same amount of applications as the control group, but did so *sooner* than the control, that difference would be missed. 

To this end, I propose using two analytical approaches. The first is a simple Probit model. For the outcome variable, I determine which families with children born during the RCT were observed during some fixed period of time. I will then pool all families and regress whether or not they were observed on vector of observed characteristics, eligibility, assignment group, and other variables, like distance from the DSS office. 

This first approach is mostly to determine if there is really a "there" there. It is inelegant and ignores some very important aspects of the application process. For example, this totally ignores that eligibility for social services is dynamic. Most families, for example, only receive SNAP benefits for a few months at a time. However, this model is useful if I make the assumption that these dynamic shifts between the two groups are, on average, the same. That is, I'm assuming the two groups are balance in both observable and unobservable character, such as eligibility, even over time. 

The second model will be a Cox proportional hazard (Cox PH) models for recurrent events. These event models explicitly account for time and counts. I must admit, though, that these recurrent event models are relatively new to me but I understand the basics enough to get how to structure the data. (I can certainly see that there is a relationship between Poisson regression and any hazard model.) I'm still deciding what type of Cox PH model suits this study (see Chapters 7 and 8 of @aalen_survival_2008).

I've also thought about creating a dynamic choice model where, from week to week (or month to month), an individuals is either eligible for a particular social program. If so, then the individual decides whether or not to apply for a specific assistance program. Unfortunately, I do not know enough about these dynamic decision models and will need to read up on them more before suggesting anything.

### Poisson Regression Model with Pooled Data {-}

Assume I've collected data for some fixed interval of time $T$ and know the complete population of RCT individuals, $N$. Any individual observed applying for assistance is tagged $y_i=1$. Those never observed are tagged $y_i=0$. I'm assuming that the treated and control groups are balanced along both observed and unobserved characteristics. The probit model is as follows:

$$
w^* = \bm{x'\beta}  + \delta D + u, \quad u \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
$$

$$
P(y=1|\bm{x}, D) = \Phi \left (\frac{\bm{x'\beta}  + \delta D}{\sigma} \right ), \quad
y = \left \{ 
  \begin{array}{cc} 
    1 & \text{ if } w^* > 0 \\ 
    0 & \text{ otherwise}
  \end{array} 
  \right .
$$

$$
\star ~ E[u|D] = 0 ~ \star
$$

The emphasis on $E[u|D] = 0$ is to reiterate that assignment, $D$, was random, and is therefore *exogenous*. What I care to find out is the difference in probability of observing *any* social service application given $D$. Furthermore, my hypothesis is that it leads to an *increase*, such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
  E[y|\bm{x}, D=1] - [y|\bm{x}, D=0] &> 0 \\
  \\
  \Rightarrow E \left [ 
        \Phi \left (\frac{\bm{x'\beta}  + \delta}{\sigma} \right )
      -
        \Phi \left (\frac{\bm{x'\beta}}{\sigma} \right )
     \right ]  &> 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Of course, since $E[u|D] = 0$, the average treatment effect (ATE) is sufficient (and without bias)
