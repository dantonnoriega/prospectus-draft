# Healthy Food Experiments (BECR Project)

I'm working with a BECR Center team that is piloting a few random experiments. The aim is to nudge people towards purchasing healthier snacks. They are working in partnership with [Family Fare Convenience Stores](http://familyfareconveniencestores.com) to run the experiments and collect the data.

In exchange for a co-authorship, I am helping will all things data. 

I'm listing this to point out that **I have a back up paper**.
