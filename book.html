<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Problem</h3>
<p>SNAP recipients, compared to higher income groups, tend to purchase more unhealthy foods and fewer fruits and vegetables. This is known as the “Nutrition Gap”. These individual choices, in aggregate, produces a negative externality: poor diet—one consisting of processed foods and other products high in sugar, salts, and fats—is closely linked to adverse health outcomes e.g. obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. But the health care costs of these diet-related conditions are not paid for by SNAP recipients but by taxpayers. Policymakers, therefore, should be looking for cost-effective was to incentivize SNAP recipients towards making healthier food choices.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="questions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Question(s)</h2>
<p>How effective would a targeted subsidy aimed be at reducing the nutrition gap? Specifically, could a subsidy aimed at increasing the fruit and vegetables purchases of SNAP recipients make a significant impact on overall diet? And would the costs of the subsidy justify the health care savings?</p>
</div>
<div id="case-study" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Case Study</h2>
<p>To date, the most successful fruit and vegetable subsidy program for SNAP recipients has been the <a href="http://www.doubleupfoodbucks.org/"><strong>Double Up Food Bucks</strong></a> program. The program has expanded into grocery stores since receiving funding from the 2014 Farm Bill. Point-of-sale data was collected which allows researchers to observed how the subsidy is being used by consumers. <strong>No analysis of the point-of-sale data has yet been provided</strong>.</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>SNAP–know as “Food Stamps” prior to 2008–was created to help mitigate food insecurity in the US. The intention of policymakers was to ensure a basic, minimal level of food security for low-income families. Other than obvious vices, like alcohol and cigarettes, there are no restrictions on what food items (excluding pet food) can be purchased with SNAP. Consumer are free to purchase unhealthy food or healthy food choices. Within the context of the US obesity epidemic and alarmingly high rates of diet-related illnesses (e.g. type 2 diabetes, heart disease) food choices of SNAP recipients has come under scrutiny because they frequently purchase unhealthy products. - This is a problem because SNAP recipients tend to also be Medicaid recipients. - Given the link between poor diet and poor health outcomes, the government would ideally prefer that SNAP recipients make healthier choices. But they do not. - These health choices, some have argued, are a function of <em>budget constraints</em>. That is, folks purchase unhealthy foods because they are cheaper, per calorie, then healthy foods. Therefore, while not optimal for health, it is optimal/rational given small budget for food. - But there is evidence to suggest that often SNAP recipients do not optimize on price (e.g. purchase brand-name products over private label produces when they are essentially substitutes). Therefore taste, not price, cannot be SNAP recipients price - This is in contrast to WIC, another food subsidy program, which limits the set of food items that can be purchased.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Why is this interesting and why should we care?</h2>
<pre><code>- As a Society
    + There are potentially fairness/equity issues here.
        - Yes, some SNAP recipients buy unhealthy foods because they taste better and likely not substitute if provided cheaper and healthier alternatives. But these individuals exists across all income groups.
        - There will also exists households that are forced to make choices between *healthy but less quantity* and *less healthy but more quantity*. Is that fair?
    + There are societal costs (externalities) to having SNAP recipients eat unhealthy foods.
        - Increases the costs of Medicaid and Medicare (more heart disease, type 2 diabetes)
        - Reduces productivity (poor diet, poor health results in worse labor market participation)
- As policymakers
    * Can SNAP be tweaked to nudge participants towards healthier foods without restricting food options?
    * If so, can it be done such that the costs are justified by future savings?</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What have others done to solve the problem or answer the question?
<ul>
<li>Health Incentives Pilot (HIP)
<ul>
<li>Large, expensive RCT designed by USDA FNS run in Massachusetts</li>
<li>RCT and evaluation was conducted by Abt Associates Inc.</li>
<li>Complicated with very little (<em>%6</em>) of the overall costs going to the actual subsidy.</li>
<li>Evidence that the program was not well understood by participants.</li>
<li>Results were an small increase in serving size of fruits/vegetables per month
<ul>
<li>This is not a surprise; one should expect the consumption of any good that becomes cheaper to go up.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Problems
<ul>
<li>Survey-based data</li>
<li>POS data did exists but did not seem to be used.</li>
<li>No real understanding of how other purchases were affected (did households substitute healthy for unhealthy or just purchase more food overall?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Double Up Food Bucks
<ul>
<li>Program started by the Fair Food Network in 2009 to increase accessibility of Farmer’s Markets to low-income communities in Detroit, MI area.
<ul>
<li>Provided a dollar-for-dollar match of SNAP benefits (capped at $20)</li>
<li>Participants received a token that could then be used on any locally grown (MI) produce.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Popular with participants, community, and with local farmers.</li>
<li>Considered successful and received money from US Gov to expand into grocery stores</li>
<li>Problems
<ul>
<li>Severe self-selection issues (folks visiting farmer’s market are different from rest of SNAP population)</li>
<li>No way to gather transaction-level data about what was being purchased</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Has no been evaluated to see if actually produces a worthwhile treatment effect</strong>
<ul>
<li>That said, should that matter? Perhaps given money to poor people that then goes to local farmers is a good use of public funds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What have I done to answer the question?
<ul>
<li>Received data from FFN and started cleaning it
<ul>
<li>Data is from 3 independent grocery stores that have implement DUFB and gathered POS data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drafted report with list of questions about how the process works</li>
<li>Phone call with FFN to answer questions</li>
<li>Working on follow-up report</li>
<li>Problem
<ul>
<li>Do no have access to data prior to DUFB implementation</li>
<li>Lots of missing data</li>
<li>Not panel data; cannot uniquely identify individuals across time</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
