<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Chronic conditions like obesity, heart disease, and other metabolic risk factors (stroke, type II diabetes, etc.) are estimated to cost the US health care system between 200 to 400 billion dollars annually <span class="citation">(Cawley and Meyerhoefer <a href="#ref-cawley_medical_2012">2012</a>; Chatterjee et al. <a href="#ref-chatterjee_checkup_2014">2014</a>)</span>. More importantly, these diseases account for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. Heart disease alone is the leading cause of death for all persons in the US, with stroke fifth and diabetes seventh <span class="citation">(National Center for Health Statistics <a href="#ref-national_center_for_health_statistics_health_2015">2015</a>)</span>. Diet is closely linked to these conditions, particularly obesity and cardiovascular disease. There is strong evidence that a diet high in (1) vegetables, fruits, nuts, unsaturated oils, fish, and poultry, but low in (2) red and processed meat and sugar-sweetened foods and drinks, helps lower body weight, blood pressure, and the risk of cardiovascular disease <span class="citation">(Mente et al. <a href="#ref-mente_systematic_2009">2009</a>; Nutrition Evidence Library <a href="#ref-nutrition_evidence_library_series_2014">2014</a>)</span>. Improving the diet of Americans has therefore become an increasing priority for the United States, especially for struggling families that participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP) program.</p>
<p>SNAP is a federal aid program administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). At 74 billion dollars in FY2015 with roughly 45.8 million participants, it is the largest food assistance program in the US <span class="citation">(USDA FNS <a href="#ref-usda_fns_supplemental_2016">2016</a><a href="#ref-usda_fns_supplemental_2016">b</a>)</span>. To be eligible for SNAP, a household must be sufficiently budget constrained that hunger is considered likely without assistance. Eligibility is a function of countable resources, vehicle ownership and value, household size, gross or net monthly income, household composition, and meeting certain work requirements.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some eligibility requirements vary by state, but in general, a family with less than $2000 in countable resources, where the adults work at least part-time earning a gross (net) monthly income at or below 130% (100%) of the federal poverty line, is eligible to receive SNAP benefits. Aside from a few restrictions—no alcohol, tobacco, non-food items, read-to-eat meals, or hot foods—households can use SNAP benefits to purchase any foods that will be prepared and consumed at home. Unfortunately, the purchasing patterns of the average SNAP household are not conducive to a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Research on the dietary patterns of households receiving SNAP benefits has found that they are significantly <em>less</em> likely to meet USDA dietary guidelines than the average US household and much <em>more</em> likely to consume unhealthy foods <span class="citation">(Andreyeva, Tripp, and Schwartz <a href="#ref-andreyeva_dietary_2015">2015</a>; Nguyen and Powell <a href="#ref-nguyen_supplemental_2015">2015</a>; Wolfson and Bleich <a href="#ref-wolfson_fruit_2015">2015</a>)</span>. A smaller set of research has found that SNAP households, at best, consume same amount of unhealthy foods (e.g. sugar-sweetened beverages, baked goods, snacks, candy, etc) compared to SNAP-ineligible households <span class="citation">(Todd and Ploeg <a href="#ref-todd_caloric_2014">2014</a>; Hoynes, McGranahan, and Schanzenbach <a href="#ref-hoynes_snap_2015">2015</a>)</span>. In other words, SNAP households consume foods that are less healthy or about the same as SNAP-ineligible households. This is a concerning result given that most US households, regardless of income, already purchase and consume far too much meat and foods rich in sugars and fats, and far too few fruits, vegetables and whole grains <span class="citation">(USDA <a href="#ref-usda_scientific_2015">2015</a>; Frazão <a href="#ref-frazao_high_1999">1999</a>)</span>. However, the purpose of SNAP is to keep struggling families from going hungry, not to ensure they consume the best possible diet. SNAP is designed to act like cash, helping families access more food than they could otherwise do so without assistance <span class="citation">(Hoynes, McGranahan, and Schanzenbach <a href="#ref-hoynes_snap_2015">2015</a>)</span>. It is therefore not a failing of the SNAP program if benefits are used to purchase unhealthy foods.</p>
<p>The SNAP program could be change such that it could continue satisfying its role as an anti-hunger program while simultaneously encouraging healthier purchases. <span class="citation">Blumenthal et al. (<a href="#ref-blumenthal_strategies_2014">2014</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Leung et al. (<a href="#ref-leung_qualitative_2013">2013</a>)</span> both surveyed a field of stakeholders and policy experts in the SNAP program about what they would do to improve the dietary quality of purchases. In both studies, restricting the purchase of unhealthy foods (e.g. sugar-sweetened beverages) and promoting healthy purchases through monetary incentives were the two most popular improvements (i.e. ranked the highest or most often suggested).<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>One common suggestion is to restrict the SNAP program to the same set of eligible foods as the Woman, Infants, and Children (WIC) program <span class="citation">(Dinour, Bergen, and Yeh <a href="#ref-dinour_food_2007">2007</a>)</span>. The WIC program provides food vouchers which limit households to a select group of food products. These food products are specifically selected to ensure women and their children receive nutritious, healthy foods. In other words, the WIC program, by design, places restrictions on food choices by defining a list of <em>eligible</em> items, as opposed to the SNAP program, which defines a list of <em>ineligible</em> items. Another common, and simpler, suggestion is to expand the existing list of ineligible items (e.g. alcohol) with products that are unambiguously lacking in nutrition and easy to identify, like soda or candy. New York City, for example, attempted to ban the purchase of sugar-sweetened beverages, and the state of Maine attempted to restrict the purchase of sodas, candy, and any other taxable food items <span class="citation">(Gundersen <a href="#ref-gundersen_snap_2015">2015</a>)</span>. Both restrictions were overturned by the USDA.</p>
<p>There are problems with “improving” the SNAP program by implementing even greater purchasing restrictions. First, there is no reason to believe that such a restriction would work. The restriction assumes that, under WIC-like requirements, households will substitute healthy foods for unhealthy foods when using SNAP benefits. What would most likely happen is that households would shift to purchasing unhealthy foods with cash. Second, such restrictions would likely lead to a drop in SNAP participation <span class="citation">(Gundersen <a href="#ref-gundersen_snap_2015">2015</a>)</span>. Restricting choice is a paternalistic policy that would further stigmatize SNAP participation. It would give the impression that SNAP beneficiaries are assumed to have worse diets and that they cannot be trusted to make healthy food purchases. Participation would also drop due to increased transactions costs of purchasing items with SNAP. Not all stores would clearly mark which items were SNAP eligible nor should participants be expected to remember. The result would be longer, more frustrating shopping trips. Lastly, it is important to remember that for many SNAP recipients, freedom of choice is what makes the SNAP program popular and easy to use <span class="citation">(Edin et al. <a href="#ref-edin_snap_2013">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The most popular “improvement” was providing a monetary incentive to SNAP participants for purchasing healthy foods <span class="citation">(Blumenthal et al. <a href="#ref-blumenthal_strategies_2014">2014</a>; Leung et al. <a href="#ref-leung_qualitative_2013">2013</a>)</span>. Monetary (or financial) incentives, in this context, tend to be a rebate or voucher awarded to SNAP households for using their benefits to buy certain healthful foods, generally mineral-rich and nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables (i.e. leafy greens but not white potatoes). These monetary incentives for buying “targeted” fruits and vegetables (aka TFVs) are exclusive to SNAP participants. Much like a grocery stores loyalty card or a student ID card, retailers can “discriminate on price” (aka “target the incentive”) using SNAP Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards to identifying eligible participants. Monetary incentives in the food retail environment are popular for two main reason. First, the framing of the “improvement” is positive. Instead of “punishing” SNAP participants through paternal restriction or disincentives (not covered), monetary incentives reward participants for healthy shopping behavior <span class="citation">(Gundersen <a href="#ref-gundersen_snap_2015">2015</a>)</span>. Retailers also prefer the positive framing of monetary incentives. For the moment, monetary incentives programs for SNAP participants are not wide spread. Therefore, taking up an incentive program, assuming the cost of implementation isn’t too expensive, creates an opportunity for retailers to differentiate themselves from their competitors <span class="citation">(Hartmann <a href="#ref-hartmann_corporate_2011">2011</a>)</span>. The second reason is a strong theoretical framework established by neoclassical economics supporting incentives as an effective mechanism for changing human behavior. In practice, however, incentives have had mixed results, but there is building evidence that incentives may work in the food retail space.</p>
<p>How, why, and to what effect incentives may encourage SNAP participants to purchase more targeted fruits and vegetables will be discussed in detail below, and is the motivating question behind this paper.</p>
<div id="financial-incentives-to-encourage-healthy-food-purchases" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Financial Incentives to Encourage Healthy Food Purchases</h3>
<p>Encouraging healthy behavior through financial incentives has a long history. Results are mixed. For example, financial incentives have been shown to help individuals commit to regular exercise, improve dieting, increase weight loss, and to quit smoking, but the intended effect of the financial incentives were often only short-term (see <span class="citation">Gneezy, Meier, and Rey-Biel (<a href="#ref-gneezy_when_2011">2011</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Cawley (<a href="#ref-cawley_economy_2015">2015</a>)</span> for an overview). <span class="citation">Gneezy, Meier, and Rey-Biel (<a href="#ref-gneezy_when_2011">2011</a>)</span> also explain, through a review of the literature, that depending on the context and design, incentives can backfire, producing an effect known as “crowd out”. Crowd out occurs when an incentive displaces the intrinsic reward of a behavior (originally defined for “prosocial” behavior, like volunteering or giving blood; see <span class="citation">Bénabou and Tirole (<a href="#ref-benabou_incentives_2006">2006</a>)</span>). The behavior then becomes dependent on the extrinsic reward. As a result, having shifted from being intrinsically rewarding to extrinsically rewarding, the positive behavior continues only as long as the monetary incentive is provided. More significantly, the intrinsic reward of the behavior does not return once it has been “crowded out”. Therefore, the long-term effect of a monetary incentive can be negative, despite showing positive effects in the short-term. That said, incentives can produce successful long-term results if they are instead used as a mechanism to build good habits. This requires that the incentives be salient and produce immediate feedback without neglecting behavioral findings such as loss aversion and mental accounting <span class="citation">(John et al. <a href="#ref-john_financial_2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Given the research on incentives, it is reasonable to assume that a monetary incentive for SNAP participants to purchase healthy foods, like fruits and vegetables, may fail or even backfire. Should the act of purchasing healthy foods be intrinsically rewarding to SNAP shoppers, introducing an incentive may produce a “crowd out” effect. However, recent field experiments find that incentives can establish healthy food choice as a habit, possibly overriding any crowd out. Daily incentives encourage children to make healthier food choices in school lunchrooms, who in turn develop positive, long-term food habits <span class="citation">(Loewenstein, Price, and Volpp <a href="#ref-loewenstein_habit_2016">2016</a>; List and Samek <a href="#ref-list_behavioralist_2015">2015</a>; Belot, James, and Nolen <a href="#ref-belot_incentives_2014">2014</a>)</span>. Outside of the school lunchroom environment, <span class="citation">List, Samek, and Zhu (<a href="#ref-list_incentives_2015">2015</a>)</span> found that similar habit formation is possible with incentives in a more traditional food retail environment. In their experiment, <span class="citation">List, Samek, and Zhu (<a href="#ref-list_incentives_2015">2015</a>)</span> provided an incentive to 222 shoppers ($1) to use their rewards cards, but then randomly assigned each participant to the control group to one of three interventions: <em>information</em>, <em>incentive</em>, or <em>combination</em>. The <em>information</em> treatment was a flyer with tips on how to prepare fruit and vegetable dishes as well as the health benefits of eating more fruits and veggies. The <em>incentive</em> was an additional dollar for every 5 cups of targeted fruits and vegetables (TFVs) purchased. The <em>combination</em> treatment group included both. The intervention lasted for 5 months but each group continued to be observed for roughly 6 weeks months after. The <em>information</em> intervention had no effect, but the <em>incentive</em> and <em>combination</em> interventions on average doubled their purchase of fruits and vegetables in comparison to the control group. Most promisingly, the gap persisted with minimal shrinkage for 6 weeks following the end of the intervention. However, there was no follow up after the 6-week post-intervention period. It is therefore possible the gap closed over multiple months (as opposed to multiple weeks).</p>
<p>The design, food environment, and target of the incentive in each of these experiments is important. First, the incentive in these experiments is designed to be salient and immediate. In the school lunchroom experiments, the children are aware of the incentive and receive the reward (e.g. a small token) immediately after selecting the healthy food item. Likewise, the shoppers received their additional $1 reward for every 5 cups of TFVs at checkout. One distinction between the designs is frequency. The children are exposed to the incentive every school day in the lunchroom experiments. The shoppers, on the other hand, were exposed as frequently or as infrequently as they chose. This distinction is important, as the latter better reflects the experience of shoppers using the SNAP benefits. Second, the food environment is important because it determines what choices are available. The children have a finite set of options in the school lunchroom and they also have no outside option (besides not eating lunch). The children optimize on a relatively small set of choices and, for the duration of the intervention, the incentive always existed. Food retail environments are drastically different. There are numerous competing food choices and generally other outside options.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It is substantially more difficult for the shopper to optimize over such a large set of choices. Last, and most obviously, one set of studies targets children, the other adults. A priori, we would expect a monetary incentive to affect children differently than adults. The fact that habit formation through incentives appears possible for both target groups is promising.</p>
<p>Research where SNAP participants are the target group is nascent. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) ran the first large scale randomized control trial investigating the impact of a financial incentive for targeted fruits and vegetables in 2011. The experiment was called the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP). HIP is the precursor to every incentive program currently being funding by the USDA. It also provides the data for the few papers recently published on incentives for SNAP participants.</p>

<h3>The Healthy Incentives Pilot</h3>
<p>A brief overview of the Healthy Incentives Pilot is necessary to provide context to, and contrast with, more recent financial incentive programs.</p>
<p>The UDSA’s Food and Nutrition Services designed the Healthy Incentives Pilot. The pilot was funded by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 to test whether financial incentives would increase consumption of targeted fruits and vegetables (TFVs). SNAP participants were the target group.</p>
<p>HIP was designed as a large scale randomized control trial (RCT). FNS partnered with the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance to implement HIP. The pilot lasted from early 2011 to the end of 2012. The population included all 55,095 SNAP participants in Hampden County, MA. Hampden County is the poorest county in Massachusetts and has the highest rates of obesity and other diet-related chronic illness (e.g. type 2 diabetes).</p>
<p>Of the 55,095 SNAP participants, 7,500 were randomly assigned to the treatment group. The remainder fell into the control group. The treatment was a 30 cent (or 30%) rebate on every dollar spent on TFVs. The rebate was capped at $60 per month. To receive the rebate, selected SNAP participants had to use their EBT cards at participating retailers. The rebate, which was returned to their EBT account, could then be used on any food item. That is, the rebate could only be earned buying TFVs, but could be redeemed buying any SNAP eligible food item. Most HIP participants spent about $12 a month on TFVs, earning an average of $3.65 per month in rebates—drastically lower than the $60 per month rebate cap.</p>
<p>The evaluation was conducted using 24-hour dietary recall surveys. A total of 5,000 participants were selected to be surveyed, even split between treatment and control (2,500 HIP, 2,500 non-HIP). The first survey was conducted prior to the start of the pilot. This established a baseline. The second survey occurred 4 to 6 months in to the pilot and the third survey occurred 9 to 11 months in. (The variation, e.g. 4 to 6 months, was due to the treatment being implemented in 3 waves of 2500.)</p>
<p>The evaluation found that the 30% rebate lead to about a 26% increase in consumption of TFVs. This was equivalent to about 0.24 cups of TFVs. Roughly 60% of the increase was due to increased vegetable consumption and 40% due to increased fruit consumption. The effect, in absolute terms (0.24 cups), seems small. But a <span class="math inline">\(0.87\)</span> price elasticity, relative to other results in the literature, is quite high—<span class="math inline">\(0.7\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0.48\)</span>, on average, for fruits and vegetables, respectively <span class="citation">(Andreyeva, Long, and Brownell <a href="#ref-andreyeva_impact_2010">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite some limitations and technical problems—underreporting on the 24-hour recall survey and system glitches early in the pilot (see pages 60 and 208-210 of <span class="citation">Bartlett, Klerman, and Olsho (<a href="#ref-bartlett_evaluation_2014">2014</a>)</span>)—HIP was considered to be an overall success <span class="citation">(Klerman et al. <a href="#ref-klerman_short-run_2014">2014</a>; Olsho et al. <a href="#ref-olsho_financial_2016">2016</a>)</span>. It implemented on of the largest, most complex RCTs to isolate how incentives can increase household consumption of TFVs. It also provided a feasible model for nationwide expansion (assuming cost reductions due to economies of scale; see <span class="citation">An (<a href="#ref-an_nationwide_2015">2015</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>HIP also provides a framework for understanding how a financial incentive, expanded dramatically in one geographic area, could improve TFV consumption. But, as noted in the final HIP report, one of the most prominent retailers in Hampden County chose not to participate (page 61, <span class="citation">Bartlett, Klerman, and Olsho (<a href="#ref-bartlett_evaluation_2014">2014</a>)</span>). Its third-party processor decided it was too difficult and too costly to implement the financial incentive on its point-of-sale technology. This strategic behavior by the retailer, which had a significant presence in Hampden County, impacted where participants could use the incentive.</p>
<p>Most financial incentive programs work at the local level, expanding non-randomly. We should anticipate certain retailers (firms) to behave strategically when participating in any of these incentive programs. Likewise, we should anticipate voluntary (non-random) self-selection by SNAP beneficiaries into these financial incentives programs. To this end, more research is needed to understand the impact of incentive programs under <em>real-world</em> conditions. HIP provided evidence that incentive programs can work, but barring state-wide or nation-wide adoption of point-of-sale financial incentives, we should expect growth to occur organically under non-experimental conditions.</p>
<p>An example of such a financial incentive program for SNAP participants is the Double Up Food Bucks program (DUFB or Double Up). The non-random expansion and impact of this financial incentives program will remain the focus of this paper</p>
</div>
<div id="the-double-up-food-bucks-program" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The Double Up Food Bucks Program</h3>
<p>The success of HIP paved the way for the Food Insecurity Nutrition Initiative (FINI), established by section 4208(b) of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (aka 2014 Farm Bill). FINI—a 100-million-dollar initiative—in turn piloted numerous non-profit financial incentive programs aimed at improving the diets of SNAP participants.</p>
<p>Of specific interest is Double Up Food Bucks (DUFB or Double Up), an incentives-based program funded by FINI. In 2009, the non-profit organization Fair Food Network (FFN) launched the Double Up Food Bucks program in Detroit, Michigan. The intention of the program was to get more low-income families visiting and participating in local Detroit farmer’s markets. The mechanism for increasing participation was a dollar-for-dollar match of locally grown fruit and vegetable purchases. This subsidy was accessible only to low-income families receiving SNAP benefits, who could exchange up to $20 of their benefits for a wooden token that could be used on up to $40 worth of locally grown produce.</p>
<p>The DUFB program was considered successful given it had expanded to more than 150 farmer’s markets in 2014 from just 5 farmer’s markets in 2009. SNAP benefits have been used more than 200,000 times to purchase fresh produce, with more than 10,000 first time SNAP customers visiting farmer’s markets in 2013 alone <span class="citation">(Network <a href="#ref-fair_food_network_double_2014">2014</a>)</span>. The program is considered by Fair Food Network to be a “three-fold” win given that the program helps local low-income families buy more fresh produce, provides new customers for local farmer’s, and stimulates the local food economy. Relative to farmer’s markets in other states, DUFB did seem to be bringing in substantially more SNAP dollars ($1.7 million in Michigan versus $307,000 in Illinois, the second largest).</p>
<p>A 5.17 million dollar FINI grant was awarded to Fair Food Network to help it pilot three adjustments to the Double Up Food Buck program <span class="citation">(USDA NIFA <a href="#ref-usda_nifa_usda_2015">2015</a>)</span>. First, FFN needs to test DUFB as a year-round program in select locations instead of the current seasonal format. Second, shift away from the token system to providing DUFB electronically at point-of-sale. Third, the DUFB needs to expand from farmer’s markets into other retail environments, like supermarkets and grocery stores.</p>
<p>Successful expansion into supermarkets and grocery stores is critical. Approximately 80% of all SNAP benefits in 2015 were used in supermarkets or super stores <span class="citation">(USDA FNS <a href="#ref-usda_fns_snap_2016">2016</a><a href="#ref-usda_fns_snap_2016">a</a>)</span>. Less than 1% percent of SNAP benefits were used at local farmer’s markets. The amount of SNAP benefits used in local farmer’s markets has increased since 2009, but no where near the growth necessary to reach the type of stores most frequented by low-income families. If localized financial incentive programs like DUFB are going to be considered one of the USDA’s many tools to increase food access and combat obesity, then they must be successfully implemented and scaled across supermarkets and grocery stores. Most importantly, incentive programs like DUFB must prove they are effective in changing purchasing habits within supermarket/grocery store food environments.</p>

<h3>Double Up Food Bucks vs the Healthy Incentives Pilot</h3>
<p>There are notable differences between DUFB and HIP that make the evaluation of DUFB more difficult. In short, HIP was implemented as an RCT. DUFB implementation is not. Let’s explore in greater detail.</p>
<p>HIP had substantially more participating stores, all within the same county (Hampden County, MA). DUFB has fewer participating stores, spread across many different counties, and across many different grocery store chains. Therefore, the probability of a SNAP shopper in Hampden County having walked into a HIP participating store was much higher than a SNAP shopper walking into any DUFB participating retailer.</p>
<p>The incentive delivery mechanisms also differ. First, all SNAP beneficiaries who shop at a DUFB participating store receive the benefit automatically. In other words, SNAP households that patron a store with DUFB receive the incentive regardless of their intentions or awareness of the DUFB incentive. Therefore, evaluating DUFB has the added difficulty of identifying which shoppers are optimizing in response to DUFB, as opposed to shopping normally. In contrast, SNAP households assigned to the HIP treatment group were made aware of incentive and were eligible to use it (even if they didn’t quite understand how the incentive program worked — see <span class="citation">Bartlett, Klerman, and Olsho (<a href="#ref-bartlett_evaluation_2014">2014</a>)</span>). Households in the control group were not aware of the incentive and were not eligible to use it. And because participants were assigned, HIP evaluators could identify treated participants from control participants.</p>
<p>Second, the DUFB financial incentive is substantially larger but more restrictive. The DUFB incentive is a dollar-for-dollar match of locally grown produce purchases capped at $20 per day. The matched dollars are accrued as points on a store loyalty card. Existing points are then automatically redeemed as dollars on <em>any</em> fresh produce purchases, not just locally grown produce. In comparison, the HIP financial incentive was a return of 30 cents per dollar spent on TFVs which could be spent on <em>any</em> food item. That is, the DUFB incentive doubled the purchasing power of every dollars spent on TFVs <em>only for more TFVs</em>; the HIP incentive increased the purchasing power of every dollars spent on TFVs by 30% <em>for any SNAP eligible food item</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, the experimental designed of HIP allowed researchers to form a causal interpretation of their results; the average treatment effect is the same as the average treatment effect on the treated. Any difference in the purchase and consumption of TFV between the treatment and control groups could therefore be attributed to the incentive. This is not the case for DUFB. However, HIP implementation is the exception. How DUFB, and similar financial incentive programs are implemented, is the norm. The contribution of this paper will be evaluating and understanding the impact of DUFB, given that DUFB and similar programs are implemented in the “real-world” (non-experimental conditions)</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluating Double Up Food Bucks in Non-experimental Conditions</h3>
<p>DUFB’s expansion and implementation into supermarkets and grocery stores did not follow an experimental design. Fair Food Network searched for local partners in the Detroit area willing to participate in DUFB. Not all grocery stores, especially the smaller independent stores, had the capacity to implement the point-of-sale technology necessary for the incentive—even if FFN offered to help cover the upgrade costs. The result is a self-selected group of stores participating in DUFB. This, in some ways, parallels what occurred in HIP, where one of the largest retailers decided integrating their point-of-sale systems to include the incentive was too expensive. This type of strategic firm behavior is important to consider, even if complicates the evaluation of an incentive program like DUFB.</p>
<p>In the real world, stores seek to maximize profits and will opt to participate only if they expect to profit. Similarly, individuals will self-select into participating; participation is optional and more likely to occur with well-informed and motivated SNAP shoppers. Selection, in this case, is a feature, not a flaw, of such incentive programs when implemented by non-profits or policy makers. The evidence, thanks to HIP, exists that incentives can lead to an increase in consumption. The goal of this paper is therefore to accurately measure the effect of the DUFB on TFV purchases while taking the selection into account. That effect can then be extrapolated forward, albeit weakly, using the results of HIP, to measure changes in consumption.</p>
<p>Fair Food Network started testing and gathering data from grocery stores implementing DUFB in 2014. One of FFN’s largest partners, a Michigan grocery retail and distribution company, piloted the program in 2 of its stores in 2014. The company has since expanded to 5 stores in 2015 and then to 17 of 62 stores in 2016. Rapid scaling was possible due to the point-of-sale technology used by the company to implement DUFB across its stores. It provides, to date, the best case study of a firm strategically scaling DUFB across numerous grocery stores that span different geographic areas and populations.</p>
<p>All transaction data from 2014 - 2016 will be provided for every store that has, at any point, participated in DUFB. These data are complete (i.e. no records have been removed) and at the item level. A complete set of data will also be provided from another 15 stores where DUFB was not implemented.</p>
<p>Currently, no research exists evaluating DUFB, or similar incentive programs, using a complete set of store transaction data. HIP, for example, only had transactions records for SNAP EBT cards. Transactions, should a different tender be used by the same individual, could not be observed. Therefore, these data provide an unprecedented opportunity to analyze how the DUFB financial incentive performs under real-world conditions. This paper will be, to the best of my knowledge, the first to perform an evaluation of a financial incentive, targeted at SNAP participants, using a complete set of data, from multiple stores, across multiple years, and collected under non-experimental conditions.</p>
