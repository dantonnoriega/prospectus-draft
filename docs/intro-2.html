<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (aka “welfare reform”) replaced the old welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). TANF profoundly changed how states prioritize and spend government welfare dollars. The result has been a gutting of traditional cash assistance programs over the last 20 year. Cash assistance used to accounted for 70% of AFDC spending. Under TANF, cash assistance accounts for 26%, with ten states spending below 10% <span class="citation">(Schott, Pavetti, and Finch <a href="#ref-schott_how_2015">2015</a>)</span>. Fewer and fewer dollars now reach families in poverty with each passing year <span class="citation">(CBPP <a href="#ref-cbpp_chart_2016">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The literature on the history and consequences of TANF over the past 20 years is vast.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> For this paper, I will spotlight the consequences of two welfare reform changes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The transfer of administrative authority to county and city governments.</li>
<li>The reporting requirement for basic assistance.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, before doing so, it is important to understand how welfare was financed under AFDC and how it changed under TANF.</p>
<div id="welfare-financing-afdc-vs-tanf" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Welfare Financing: AFDC vs TANF</h3>
<p><strong>Financing the AFDC Program</strong></p>
<p>The AFDC entitlement program was financed by a federal-state matching grant system where the federal government shared the marginal cost of every dollar spent on cash assistance by the states <span class="citation">(Ziliak <a href="#ref-ziliak_temporary_2015">2015</a>)</span>. State spending on entitlements was matched by the federal government at the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), which ranged between 50% and 83% <span class="citation">(Falk <a href="#ref-falk_temporary_2016">2016</a>)</span>. The FMAP matching rate was a function of a state’s economy. This assisted and encouraged poorer states to spend money towards AFDC entitlements, even during an economic downturn.</p>
<p>The federal government, aside from helping fund AFDC, also determined eligibility requirements. Even though the states did have the option to extend some eligibility requirements, generally any impoverished mother caring for a child was eligible to receive AFDC benefits. Benefits, which came in the form of monthly cash assistance, had no work requirement between 1935 and 1967. In 1967, a small work requirement was added to received AFDC benefits, but beneficiaries were rarely sanction for failing to meet the requirement. Federal requirements shifted with passage of the Family Support Act of 1988 (FSA). FSA required mothers with children over the age of 3 to participate in an education, work, or training program to encourage a shift from welfare to work. States soon began requesting waivers to try their own welfare-to-work programs in place of AFDC <span class="citation">(Blank <a href="#ref-blank_what_2007">2007</a>)</span>. By 1996, waivers were approved for 43 states. Welfare reform, which ended the AFDC program, occurred soon after.</p>
<p><strong>Financing TANF</strong></p>
<p>TANF ended federal-state matching grant financing, replacing it with federal fixed block-grant financing. Federal TANF spending for block-grants is fixed at $16.5 billion and has been since 1996.</p>
<p>Block-grant welfare financing profoundly changed how states prioritize their spending. To receive a block-grant, states are required to spend their own funds on programs supporting one of four TANF purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C.F.R §§ 260.20 - What is the purpose of the TANF program?</p>
<p>The TANF program has the following four purposes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;</p></li>
<li><p>End the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;</p></li>
<li><p>Prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; and</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The amount spent by each state must equal to 75% of its FY1994 entitlement outlays. This is known as “maintenance-of-effort” (MOE) spending.</p>
<p>Under the TANF block-grant financing, states have one true spending incentive: to <em>hit</em> the MOE level. Failure to meet the 75% MOE threshold results in an increases to 80% the following year. States are also penalized with a dollar-for-dollar reduction equal to the shortfall between spending and the MOE threshold. However, unlike with AFDC, there is no incentive in place to encourage states to spend their TANF block-grants and no incentive to spend beyond. Under AFDC, every additional dollar was matched by the federal government. That rate would also increase if a state’s economy hit a downturn. But under TANF, the state pays the full marginal cost of every dollar spent <em>beyond</em> the TANF block-grant. Further discouraging spending is the fact that states can roll-over any unspent TANF dollars to the following year, without penalty.</p>
<p>However, it is not difficult for a state to hit its MOE. The flexibility of the four TANF purposes, particularly the 3rd and 4th (c and d), means practically any state spending is also MOE spending. There is also no requirement for states to show how spending for a program satisfies one of the four TANF purposes. The state need only outline how funds are intended to be used and the purpose it falls under.</p>
<p>This is a much easier, more desirable way to spend funds compared to the requirements when providing “assistance”. “Assistance” is defined by the US Department of Health and Human Services as any ongoing payment to families to help meet basic needs <span class="citation">(Falk <a href="#ref-falk_temporary_2016">2016</a>)</span>. Any spending that falls under this definition of assistance must be reported, in detail, to the federal government. Detailed reporting of who is receiving cash assistance, aka “caseload”, is a bureaucratic burden relative to the nonexistent reporting requirement for non-cash assistance.</p>
<p>TANF is working as intended. TANF’s block-grant financing, which replaced AFDC’s federal-state matching grant financing, was supposed to provided greater spending flexibility and authority to the states. Additionally, the reporting requirement ensure states were imposing TANF work requirements and time limits for cash assistance. I spotlight the consequences of these changes in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div id="tanf-consequences" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>TANF Consequences</h3>
<p>Granting spending authority to the states created more opportunities for discrimination against nonwhite welfare recipients. The bureaucratic machine that determines eligibility for TANF benefits functions at the local county and city level. Caseworkers at the local level wield an enormous amount of power over the delivery of services. Caseworkers determine eligibility, the size of TANF payments and, importantly, administer sanctions against beneficiaries. Local caseworkers are both the helping hand and the disciplining hammer. That power can often lead caseworkers to make biased decision–whether explicit or implicit—resulting in greater discrimination against nonwhites <span class="citation">(Schram et al. <a href="#ref-schram_deciding_2009">2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Welfare has long been associated with race. It is important to remember that welfare reform and TANF reflects the general attitudes towards welfare in the late 1990s. There were too many people were being rewarded for “non-work” and “single parenthood” <span class="citation">(Rector and Fagan <a href="#ref-rector_continuing_2003">2003</a>)</span>. The reforms were needed to reduce government dependency, child poverty, and illegitimacy, whilst also encouraging work and strengthening two-parent families. The goals and language of welfare reform, as explained by <span class="citation">Soss, Fording, and Schram (<a href="#ref-soss_disciplining_2011">2011</a>)</span>, implicitly fed prevailing negative attitudes and narratives long associated with American minorities, especially black Americans.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Should these negatives attitudes filtered down to local social services departments, there is unfortunately little beneficiaries can do to protect themselves. They are entirely at the mercy of their local caseworkers and administrators.</p>
<p>It is therefore unsurprising to learn researchers have discovered discrimination in the welfare system, especially in states with long histories of racial conflict and stratification <span class="citation">(Mannix and Freedman <a href="#ref-mannix_tanf_2013">2013</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Keiser, Mueser, and Choi (<a href="#ref-keiser_race_2004">2004</a>)</span> find that nonwhites were more likely than white to be sanctioned for failing to satisfy TANF work requirements. This was true in all local areas across the state of Missouri. <span class="citation">Wu et al. (<a href="#ref-wu_how_2006">2006</a>)</span> find similar results along race in the state of Wisconsin. Black Americans were more likely to be sanctioned than any other group in Wisconsin. They also find that offices which sanction the most also impose more barriers to receiving benefits. Moving up from the state level, <span class="citation">Monnat (<a href="#ref-monnat_color_2010">2010</a>)</span> discovered the same results hold even at the national level.</p>
<p>It is important to note that longitudinal state administrative data is what made prior research possible. These were “basic assistance” data. As explained in the previous section, detailed reporting is only required for basic assistance. Year by year, however, there are fewer and fewer states spending money on basic assistance. This means less basic assistance data available for research. But this also means more of TANF spending goes without being scrutinized.</p>
<p>In this paper, I will investigate data from a single local agency in state North Carolina. My novel contribution is the analysis of new data. These are not “basic assistance” data. These are data of “non-recurrent, short-term assistance”, which do not need to be reported. This is provides a unique opportunity to discover new findings and confirm old ones using data that is otherwise inaccessible.</p>
<p>In specifically interested in investigating the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is there any evidence of discrimination along either age, gender, race, amount of children?</li>
<li>Is there a pattern to who gets denied emergency benefits?</li>
<li>A general understanding of emergency benefits requested and received by residence of Durham County.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I must emphasize that the results of the paper will contextualize a single local agency. It is useful to learn about the agency, but it will provide limited information about the entire state. And while it may provide understanding about how other, similar agencies within the state are using non-recurrent benefits, it would be irresponsible to extrapolate to agencies within different states.</p>
