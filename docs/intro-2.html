<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Not all individuals that are eligible for social services apply to receive them. The proportion of those eligible for a social service that are actually receiving the service is known as the “take-up” rate. Ideally, given complete information about eligibility and the existence of social service programs—and zero costs in applying for, or receiving, government assistance—the take-up rate would be 100%. To do otherwise would be to “leave money on the table”—a violation of neoclassical economic theory. In the United States and across the globe, however, most social service programs never reach a full take-up rate.</p>
<p>Explanations for low take-up rates are numerous. Economists, for example, developed models of social stigma to explain an individual’s decision for not applying for government assistance <span class="citation">(Moffitt <a href="#ref-moffitt_economic_1983">1983</a>)</span>. “Stigma” broadly encompasses any cost that reduces the total utility acquired from receiving government assistance. Stigma and available benefits can vary across individuals. Those with insufficient net benefits, after considering the cost of stigma, would reasonably choose not to apply for government assistance. That is, the take-up rates can fall below 100% within any set of eligible individuals when the cost of stigma outweighs those of the benefit. We can extend the costs of stigma to include other standard costs, like transaction costs or search costs.</p>
<p>Low take-up rates can also be explained by relaxing standard neoclassical assumptions, like complete information. If one instead assumes that most individuals have <em>incomplete</em> information about existing social services programs and corresponding eligibility requirements, then lower take-up rates are unsurprising. Eligibility requirements, for example, are dynamic. Families and individuals can fall in or out of eligibility given a change in policy, leaving families with an outdated understanding of requirements. For example, following welfare reform in 1996, federal requirements shifted for programs like Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and cash assistance (renamed to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or TANF). Welfare reform also gave more power to states to determine eligibility standards. Dissemination and implementation of these new eligibility requirements was not instantaneous and the confusion lead to a reduction in take-up rates for some programs <span class="citation">(Stuber and Kronebusch <a href="#ref-stuber_stigma_2004">2004</a>)</span>. Shifting requirements aside, many families that are eligible for social service programs can be misinformed or confused. It can be difficult to navigate the application process when requesting government assistance. Information about programs and their eligibility requirements is diffuse and complicated. We do not expect everyone to fully grasp how to complete their taxes without assistance or making errors. Likewise, we should not expect families coping with poverty to be fully informed about benefit levels or the application process of every existing social service program.</p>
<p>Behavioral economics offers other compelling reasons for low take-up rates. Status quo bias, for example, is a common task-completion deterrent <span class="citation">(Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler <a href="#ref-kahneman_anomalies:_1991">1991</a>)</span>. Simple inertia means that most people will procrastinate. This can keep any person from completing things like applications, making doctors appointments, or even folding laundry. Bounded rationality and the human tendency to use heuristics for decision making also reduce take-up rates. Often, individuals assume, based on some rule-of-thumb, that they must not be eligible. If this assumption is never challenged, either by seeking out information or having it provided, then they will never discover otherwise. Time-inconsistent preferences also present a challenge for take-up rates. Hyperbolic discounting implies that humans will favor putting off any decision where gains are felt far in the future but losses are felt almost immediately. In applying for government assistance, future benefits are discounted heavily while the short-term cost of applying are not <span class="citation">(Currie <a href="#ref-currie_take-up_2006">2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A simpler explanation for low take-up rates is the existence intentional bureaucracy. Governments purposefully make the application process burdensome and confusing to deter applications. The take-up rate of TANF, for example, has plummeted since the federal government overhauled welfare in 1996 <span class="citation">(Ribar <a href="#ref-ribar_how_2014">2014</a>)</span>. TANF gave enormous leeway to states on how to distribute TANF dollars with little oversight. As a result, over the last 20 years states have shifted away from using TANF dollars for its intended purpose of providing cash assistance to needy families.</p>
<p>On average, 26 percent of TANF dollars go towards provided basic cash assistance <span class="citation">(Schott, Pavetti, and Finch <a href="#ref-schott_how_2015">2015</a>)</span>. This drop in TANF take-up rates has coincided with increasingly strict TANF eligibility requirements. This is particularly true in state and local governments with a long history of racial animus towards minorities and the “undeserving” poor, like in the deep south <span class="citation">(Keiser, Mueser, and Choi <a href="#ref-keiser_race_2004">2004</a>)</span>. North Carolina, for example, added a drug testing requirement to its TANF program known as “Work First” <span class="citation">(Lynn Bonner <a href="#ref-lynn_bonner_nc_2016">2016</a>)</span>. These requirements tend to disproportionately affect minority families because they are more likely to be sanctioned by local caseworkers for failing to meet requirements compared to white families <span class="citation">(Monnat <a href="#ref-monnat_color_2010">2010</a>)</span>. This both increase the cost of acquiring TANF benefits <em>and</em> increases the chances of losing access to an already difficult-to-acquire benefit. All in all, take-up rates for some social service programs can be low because state and local governments are actively increasing the costs for applying and maintaining benefits.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Low take-up rates should concern policy makers. The positive impact many government programs have on quality of life is well researched. For example, passage of the Affordable Care Act gave states the option to expand Medicaid coverage. This increased the pool of who was eligible for Medicaid. For those previously without health insurance, Medicaid coverage increased self-reported health status, lowered rates of depression, and reduced financial strain and poverty <span class="citation">(Baicker et al. <a href="#ref-baicker_oregon_2013">2013</a>; Sommers, Baicker, and Epstein <a href="#ref-sommers_mortality_2012">2012</a>; Sommers and Oellerich <a href="#ref-sommers_poverty-reducing_2013">2013</a>)</span>. Families that participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) increase the nutritional value of their diet and free up cash for use on other priorities, like health care <span class="citation">(Bartfeld et al. <a href="#ref-bartfeld_snap_2015">2015</a>; Sonik <a href="#ref-sonik_massachusetts_2016">2016</a>; Miller and Morrissey <a href="#ref-miller_using_2017">2017</a>)</span>. Increased use of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) increases cash on hand, improves educational outcomes for children, and improves labor market out comes for adults <span class="citation">(Grogger <a href="#ref-grogger_effects_2003">2003</a>; Bhargava and Manoli <a href="#ref-bhargava_why_2012">2012</a>; Dahl and Lochner <a href="#ref-dahl_impact_2012">2012</a>)</span>. Lastly, eligible families that participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Woman, Infants, and Children (WIC) see improved child health outcomes when compared to eligible non-participating families <span class="citation">(Bitler and Currie <a href="#ref-bitler_does_2005">2005</a>)</span>. Therefore, considering the positive impact of most government assistance programs, it should be a priority to champion any low-cost policy changes that increase take-up rates.</p>
<p>In the next section, I will introduce the Durham Connects (DC) program and how I believe it may have helped increase requests for social service programs. Note that increasing requests for social services is not equivalent to increasing take-up. A request for service, however, is a necessary first step for any eligible participant to receive benefits. Increased requests, therefore, serve as a proxy for increased take-up rates.</p>

<div id="the-durham-connects-randomized-control-trial" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The Durham Connects Randomized Control Trial</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.durhamconnects.org/about/">Durham Connects</a> (DC) program is a postnatal nurse home-visiting program designed to be universal, short-term, and less intensive than other nurse home-visiting programs like Healthy Families America and Nurse-Family Partnership. The DC program, in brief, aims to celebrate with new mothers, support and connect then with community resources, and then follow-up if necessary.</p>
<p>Before expanding, a randomized control trial (RCT) of the DC program was implemented from July 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010 to determine its efficacy. The RCT included <code>4777</code> births from two Durham hospitals. These two hospitals account for a vast majority of births in Durham County. The randomization procedure assigned all babies born on even days to the DC program. Babies born on odd days were assigned to the control group, and were not invited to receive a DC home visit.</p>
<p>For those assigned to the treatment group, soon after birth a DC program liaison at the hospital scheduled a home-visit by a registered nurse with the infant’s family. The initial home-visit was generally scheduled about 3 weeks following the birth. During the initial home-visit, the nurse assessed and rated 12 factor along 4 domains of family support: health of the mother and child, the safety of the home environment, planning care for the infant, and general wellbeing of the parent(s). Each of the 12 factors received a rating between <code>1</code> and <code>4</code> from the home-visiting Nurse. Each number represented varying levels of need and risk:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>1</code> - No risk/needs. General supportive guidance provided.</li>
<li><code>2</code> - Low risk/needs. Concerns can be addressed by education and in-home demonstrations during visit.</li>
<li><code>3</code> - Moderate or high risk/needs. Family are linked with community resources best suited to support risk areas.</li>
<li><code>4</code> - Urgent needs. Immediate intervention required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow-up visits were scheduled as necessary. Generally, the more support a family needs, the more follow-up visits would occur.</p>
<p>Prior research has used the RCT to evaluate some aspects of DC. Notably, <span class="citation">Dodge et al. (<a href="#ref-dodge_implementation_2013">2013</a>)</span> found that the DC nurse home-visiting program reduced emergency medical care costs and increase health outcomes for both mother and child. Furthermore, the DC program was found to be cost-effective, saving an estimated 3 dollars in medical costs for every dollar spent on implementation. In short, DC was impressively successful at improving the physical health and mental health of mother and child.</p>
<p>I’m interested in using the randomized assignment to measure what I would consider a secondary effect of the nurse home-visiting program. An essential part of the program was establishing a link between DC families and Durham Social Services (DSS) to “facilitate the … ease of access to and knowledge about eligible services” <span class="citation">(O’Donnell and Wright <a href="#ref-odonnell_family_2015">2015</a>)</span>. I hypothesize that by providing a trusted contact (the nurse), educational resources, and a link to local social services, a secondary effect of the DC program was that participants had a higher application rate for social services than non-participants.</p>
<p>The nurse–patient relationship is key to the success of the DC program. The days and weeks following a new birth are periods of high need for both mother and child <span class="citation">(Organization and others <a href="#ref-organization_who_2013">2013</a>; Evans et al. <a href="#ref-evans_cohort_2001">2001</a>)</span>. High need for postnatal/postpartum support means new mothers and families are more willing to accept help when offered—especially from nurses and nurse-centered programs. Patients, generally, view nurses favorably, but interactions tend to be viewed more positively when they occur outside the hospital/clinic environment <span class="citation">(Jansson et al. <a href="#ref-jansson_first-time_2002">2002</a>)</span>. Likewise, perceptions about community health programs tends to be more positive when they are known to be organized and conducted by nurses <span class="citation">(Kneipp, Lutz, and Means <a href="#ref-kneipp_reasons_2009">2009</a>)</span>. Nurses that assist in home-visiting program for new mothers, in particular, tend to be viewed very positively by their patients—as both a professional expert and friend <span class="citation">(Landy et al. <a href="#ref-landy_mothers_2012">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>While initial DC home-visits may be brief in some cases (e.g. rating is <code>1</code>), new mothers requiring the most support and resources are visited more than once. Nurses are most involved with families that receive factors rated <code>3</code> or <code>4</code>. In these instances, families are <em>referred</em> to Durham Social Services for help. That is, DSS is made aware that the family is in need of a specific type of support and, with the help of the nurse, links up with the family directly. This is distinct to families with factors of only <code>1</code> and/or <code>2</code>. For these families, nurses only <em>recommend</em> community services and resources. The option to utilize the resources is then left to the family.</p>
<p>In both cases, however, notice that the nurse is, in one way or another, reducing the costs associated with applying for social services. At a minimum, the nurse reduces the <em>search</em> costs for families by provided information for resources. At a maximum, the nurse connects families with DSS directly to determine eligible services. In the latter case, the nurse, in partnership with DSS, also lowers the <em>transaction cost</em> of applying.</p>
<p>I should pause to specify what it meant for a family to be “connected with DSS”. It is my understanding that this means a family was put in contact with, or place “on the radar” of, a specific DSS worker assigned to assist DC families (name omitted). The degree, and success, to which this worker was involved in assisting families apply for services would have had a impact on application rates. I have yet to interview this person, but I plan on doing so.</p>
