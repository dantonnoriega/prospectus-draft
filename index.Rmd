# Dissertation Overview {-}

The broader goal of my dissertation is to explore existing policies aimed at improving access to, the coverage of, and the efficacy of, government assistance programs. I will do so in three studies. The first measures the impact of a financial incentive that may or may not increase access to fresh produce for SNAP participants. The second investigates if a low-cost, universal nurse home-visiting program can, as a secondary effect, help eligible families receive assistance sooner and/or more frequently. The third aims to continue building the case that in-kind transfer programs, while critical to families coping with poverty, remain insufficient, leaving families living month to month and vulnerable to emergencies.

## Chapter Summaries {-}

Chapter 1 is an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Double Up Food Bucks program. "Effectiveness" will be defined by the change in total sales and volume of produce sold within 17 grocery stores that implement Double Up (treatment group), compared to the control group of 15 stores where Double Up was not implemented. A difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity design will be used to measure the size of the effect.

Improving health and food equity of SNAP participants is the broader policy concern. The mechanism is a financial incentive---Double Up Food Bucks---designed to increase fruit and vegetables consumption. A comparison will be made with another financial incentive program called the *Healthy Incentives Pilot* (HIP). I will argue how and why an evaluation of the Double Up program is an important addition to the current literature.

Chapter 2 exploits the random assignment of the Durham Connects program to measure its long term impact on social service applications. Durham Connects (DC) provides free in-home nursing visits to residents of Durham County who have just given birth. It was implemented as an RCT between July 2009 to December 2010. The design treats DC as an information treatment. The DC information treatment (e.g. a nurse contact to ask questions and provide assistance) is expected to lower the learning and barrier costs of low-income families with children when applying for social services.

Chapter 3 aims to build on the work of @schenck-fontaine_use_2016. Through surveys, @schenck-fontaine_use_2016 examine how families coping with poverty and economic instability supplement their SNAP benefits with additional assistance from informal and formal resources. In my paper, I dig into how and when families use additional formal resources beyond SNAP by analyzing food pantry donations data and administrative records of emergency assistance applications.
