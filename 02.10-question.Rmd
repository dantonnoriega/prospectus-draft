# The Durham Connects RCT and Applications for Social Services {#chapter-2}


## Motivation {-}

**Research Question**

> Did assignment to the Durham Connects (DC) RCT impact a family's future probability of applying for social services?  That is, for families assigned to DC during the trail period, I want to see if the intervention (nurse home-visit) increased the probability of applying for social services *sooner* and/or overall.

**Hypothesis**: I expect to observe a larger proportion of families, randomly assigned to the Durham Connects program, requesting social services. This would include social services like the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Child Care Subsidies, and Medicaid.

My hypothesis is that the information and nurse contact provided to DC families decreased the complexity of applying and navigating the social safety net. As a result, I expected DC families will be observed applying for social services sooner and/or more frequently, not because they are, on average, in greater need of assistance, but because they were better informed and more encouraged to seek out available resources.

The RCT design of the Durham Connects program allows me to make certain assumptions with reasonable confidence. Without these assumption, my research question would be difficult to answer.

The first assumption is that random assignment resulted in balanced groups. Eligibility for social services is a function of income and demographics, and I'm assuming these are, on average, the same between the treatment and control groups. I have no way to test balance along income, but I can attempt to check balance along race/ethnicity using first and last names.

The second assumption is a high compliance rate. I'm assuming that a majority of families assigned to DC accept and commit to the nurse home-visit. This assumption should be easy to verify. Compliance is important because any effect the nurse home-visit may have on social service application is going to be driven by the complying population. The nurse is who assesses the mother and child's health and home environment. These assessments, in turn, determine follow-up visits, educational resources, recommendations to programs, and, if needed, referrals---the mechanisms that I believe reduced learning and administrative costs.

The last assumption, related to the first, is valid model identification. Assignment to DC is random. By construction, it's exogenous to observable and unobservable variables. It's also easy to defend the idea that assignment to DC has a direct impact on recommendations and referrals by nurse home-visitors. Assuming valid model identification is reasonable given such a good instrument.
