# The Durham Connects RCT and Requests for Social Services {#chapter-2}


## Motivation {-}

**Research Question**

> Did assignment to the Durham Connects (DC) RCT impact the future probability of applying for social services?  That is, for families assigned to DC during the trail period, I want to see if the intervention (nurse home-visit) increase the probability of applying for social services sooner (or at all).

**Hypothesis**: I expect to observed a larger proportion of families, randomly assigned to the Durham Connects program, requesting social services. This would include social services like the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Child Care Subsidies, and Medicaid. My hypothesis is that the information and nurse contact provided to DC families decreased the complexity of applying and navigating the social safety net. As a result, DC families are observed applying for services sooner and/or more frequently, not because they are, on average, in greater need of assistance, but because they have been informed and encouraged to seek out available resources.
