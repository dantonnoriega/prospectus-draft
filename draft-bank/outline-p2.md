# Paper 2 --- SNAP Benefit Schedule and Demand for Formal Assistance (Reduced)

> **Question:** Do request for additional assistance increase during the off-cycles of household SNAP benefit schedules?

> **Hypothesis**: I expect to see a small but significant increase towards the last 2 weeks of the month following SNAP transfer benefits. That is, I expect to reject the null hypothesis that a SNAP recipient's request for assistance is uniformly distributed across any given month.

## Introduction

**Part 1**: Millions of families depend on SNAP benefits to provide sustained, predictable access to food. With reduced access to TANF benefits, SNAP has become the most popular cash-like assistance available to struggling families.

**Part 2**: Economic theory assumes families have some access to cash. SNAP benefits therefore act as a buffer, alleviating strained food budgets and allowing families to shift cash towards other SNAP-ineligible goods. Unfortunately, monthly SNAP benefits are insufficient for many of the poorest families.

**Part 3**: Spending is highest within the first 3 days of receiving SNAP benefits. Days leading up to the next scheduled monthly transfer, families often have no benefits left to spend on food. Low on cash, families tighten their belts and eat less nutritious foods. They also turn to informal and formal (e.g. social services) safety nets for assistance. 

**Part 4**: For families coping with poverty, informal safety nets (e.g. family, friends) tend to be the first line of defense should formal safety nets (e.g. SNAP) fall short. However, informal safety nets are not always available. Family and friends for those coping with poverty often struggle with similar levels of economic insecurity. Limited access to cash means families on the most extreme margins will turn to formal networks of support, like food banks or emergency social services for assistance.

**Part 5**: Formal services exists that can provide families with emergency cash to pay for necessities like rent, electricity, and food. Food banks are an example of formal service that could be considered emergency assistance for some families (although not for all, unfortunately). Emergency cash assistance also exists to help with rent and utilities but access can be quite restricted. Durham Count Social Services, for example, provides emergency TANF assistance, which is limited to a $400 dollars per 365 days. Emergency food cards also exists, but SNAP recipients are ineligible.[^One of the conditions to receiving a food card is that households must sign up for SNAP.]

**Part 6**: Scarcity of cash should increase demand for support for informal and formal cash assistance. This is most likely to occur during the last and first weeks of the month given North Carolina's SNAP benefits transfer schedule. I test this by checking household demand for emergency cash services and demand for Food Bank assistance in Durham County.


 



**Extra**: Cash assistance reaches fewer families since the 1996 welfare reform act. SNAP, on the other hand, has become the largest public assistance program in the US, peaking during the worst years of the Great Recession. While SNAP is a cash-like assistance program, it is still not cash. It cannot pay the rent or the bills. And when economic instability forces families to make tough decisions, especially those on the margins of poverty, it is a lack of cash that prompts families to search for help from formal and informal networks.
