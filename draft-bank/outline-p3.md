# Paper 3 --- Durham Connects as an Information Treatment

> **Question:** For families that participated in the Durham Connects program, did the information and nurse contact impact the probability of applying for social services?

> **Hypothesis**: I expect to observed a larger proportion of families that participated in Durham Connects requesting social services. My hypothesis is that the information and nurse contact provided to DC families decreased the complexity of applying and navigating the social safety net. As a result, DC families are observed more frequently not because they are, on average, in greater need of assistance, but because they have been informed and encouraged to seek out available resources.
