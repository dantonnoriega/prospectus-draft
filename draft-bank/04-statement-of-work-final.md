# Objective

There has been increased interest in targeted financial incentives designed to encourage shoppers to purchase healthier foods, like fruits in vegetables. Double Up Food Bucks (Double Up), a project launched in 2009 by the non-profit Fair Food Network, is one particular targeted incentive program. Double Up doubles the purchasing power of consumers who received benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), but the doubling only works on fresh, healthy produce.

Initially only available at farmer's markets, Double Up began expanding into supermarkets in 2013. This expansion accelerated in 2014 with a 5 million dollar grant from the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI). Double Up is now being implemented across numerous stores in the Michigan area, with similar programs being launched and funded in numerous other states. The success of the program---whether it increases the volume of fresh fruits and vegetables purchased by SNAP shoppers---depends heavily on the collection of transaction data from stores implementing (and not implementing) Double Up. These data are slowly becoming available to researchers, providing an exciting and unprecedented opportunity to better understand how financial incentives work as a public health and policy tool.

These data would not exist without the participation of Michigan grocery stores. The participation of SpartanNash, in particular, is notable given that it is, so far, the only retailer providing data over multiple years, multiple stores, and, uniquely, stores that have *not* implemented Double Up. SpartanNash is also the only retailer to have adopted a fully electronic POS tracking and distribution system to distribute Double Up benefits. With these data, researchers will, for the first time, have the ability to estimate the effect of financial incentives targeted directly at SNAP shoppers *using transaction data*. 

# Aims and Hypotheses

Aims 1 and 2 overlap with the aims of the USDA and Fair Food Network. Both are interested in measuring the efficacy of Double Up Food Bucks. Aims 3, 4, and 5 are of interest to academics.

**Aim 1**: Measure the impact of Double Up Food Bucks on the *volume of fresh produce purchased* using SNAP benefits and Double Up points.

* *Hypothesis*: The volume of fresh produce purchased using SNAP benefits as a fraction of all goods purchased will increase relative to stores that are have not implemented Double Up (control stores). The magnitude, while positive and significant, will be quite small.

**Aim 2**: Measure the impact of Double Up Food Bucks on the *overall nutritional composition of purchases* made using SNAP benefits and Double Up points.

* *Hypothesis*: The purchase volume of more healthful foods beyond items eligible for DUFB (whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy) will *not* increase among SNAP transactions at Double Up (intervention) stores relative to control stores. The incentive will only increase purchases along one dimension: eligible items.

**Aim 3**: Investigate if there is any evidence of *moral licensing* during the redemption of Double Up points.
    
* *Hypothesis*: The nutritional composition of purchases made redeeming Double Up points will be low compared to when points were mostly earned. Customers will reward themselves for having saved money and purchased healthy foods by buying unhealthy foods.

**Aim 4**: Investigate the rate at which Double Up points are earned and redeemed. Specifically, measure how many dollars of the possible 20 dollars per day are used in SNAP transactions.
    
- *Hypothesis*: The rate at which Double Up points are earned and redeemed will be substantially lower than what economic theory would expect of a rational, optimizing consumer. The lack of *salience* and loss of *transaction utility*---a trade-off of using an automated system that earns and redeems points--are expected to be large contributing factor. This will be challenging to measure.

**Aim 5**: Measure how the SNAP benefits schedule affects the overall sale of produce purchased, on average, during the first 3 weeks of each month and compare it to the last week of each month.

- *Hypothesis*: If consumers indeed respond to the Double Up incentive, then there will only be an increase in the purchase of fruits and vegetables while they have available benefits. Once SNAP benefits are consumed and the incentive cannot be used, consumers will stop purchasing extra produce. As a result, produce purchased as a fraction of all goods at intervention stores during the last week of the month will be roughly equivalent to control stores.

# Scope

We plan to present the results of our research using these data to select organizations and conferences. Organizations interested in this research include FFN, the USDA, and the FAR Foundation. Conferences would include APPAM and the AEA annual meetings. At least one journal article is expected to be published from this project in a peer-reviewed economics journal. These data will also be used in the dissertation of Danton Noriega, a PhD Student at Duke University.

# Research Design and Methods

Store selection for the 15 control store is being accomplished via matching on observables and the construction of a deterministic running variable function. 

Empirical methods will comprise different modeling designs. The effect of the Double Up incentive will be estimated using 9 of the 11 stores that did not ask to be part of Double Up. The effect for these stores will be estimated either with a Regression Discontinuity design or Difference-in-Difference model with fixed-effects. The nature of the data will determine which of the two models is more appropriate. 

A simple Difference model with fixed effects will be used on the subset of stores that were included in DUFB beginning in 2016. These stores will be compared to themselves in 2015 and 2014.

Unfortunately, estimating effects at the customer level will not be possible given the exclusion of Loyalty Card numbers. All effects will therefore be measured at the store-level. While the overall sample size of stores is small, substantial variation is added by having observations over time from 2014-2016. Furthermore, store-level estimates will be incredibly precise given the sheer number of data points that will be used to estimate them.
