# Background and Significance

Unhealthy eating is expensive. Obesity, heart disease, and other metabolic risk factors (stroke, type II diabetes, etc) are chronic conditions that account for more than 300 billion dollars annually in health care expenditures [@chatterjee_checkup_2014]. More importantly, diseases linked to poor diet account for hundreds of thousands of death each year. Heart disease alone is the leading cause of death for all persons in the US, with stroke fifth and diabetes seventh [@national_center_for_health_statistics_health_2015]. Improving dietary health of American households has therefore become an ever-increasing priority for the United States.

Obesity and heart disease rates vary by income, affecting more low-income families than middle- and high-income families. Research on the dietary patterns of households receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP) benefits has found that they are significantly *less* likely to meet USDA dietary guidelines than the average US household and much *more* likely to consume unhealthy foods [@andreyeva_dietary_2015; @nguyen_supplemental_2015; @wolfson_fruit_2015]. 

This nutritional disparity is driven by many factors, the most consequential being lack of income. SNAP is first and foremost an anti-hunger program, not health and nutrition program. To qualify, a household must be sufficiently budget constrained that hunger is considered likely without cash assistance. As a consequence, SNAP beneficiaries can often not afford the luxury of substituting healthy foods for unhealthy foods when unhealthy foods are cheaper and more abundant. It is a costly trade-off between hunger and health. 

Economic theory suggests that behavior can be altered through financial incentives. 

In the past few years, some non-profit programs have started testing financial incentives as a way to encourage SNAP eligible families to buy healthier foods. To help accelerate the growth of these programs, the Agricultural Act of 2014 established the Food Insecurity Nutrition Initiative (FINI) to fund different pilot projects nationwide. 

Of specific interest is Double Up Food Bucks (Double Up), an incentives-based program funded by FINI. Double Up, launched in 2009 by the non-profit organization Fair Food Networks (FFN), doubles the purchasing power of SNAP recipients buying produce. Dollars spent on Michigan produce are match up to $20 dollars, but the matching funds can only be used to purchase more fruits and vegetables at a later date. The program is considered by FFN to be a "three-fold" win: it helps local low-income families buy more fresh produce, provides new customers for local farmers, and stimulates the local food economy [@fairfoodnetwork_double_2014].

However, successful expansion into supermarkets and grocery stores is critical. Approximately three-quarters of all SNAP benefits in 2009 were used in supermarkets, super-centers, or small to large grocery stores [@castner_benefit_2011]. Less than 7% percent of SNAP benefits were used at local farmers markets. The amount of SNAP benefits used in local farmers markets has increased since 2009, but no where near the growth necessary to reach the type of stores most frequented by low-income families. If incentive programs like Double Up are going to be considered as one of the USDA's many tools to increase food access and combat obesity, then Double Up must be successfully implemented and scaled across supermarkets and grocery stores. Above all else, Double Up must prove it is effective in changing purchasing habits within the supermarket/grocery store food environment.

A 5.17 million dollar FINI grant was awarded to Fair Food Network to help it pilot three adjustments to Double Up Food Buck [@usda_nifa_usda_2015]. The first is to expand the Double Up Food Bucks program from farmers markets to retail supermarkets and grocery stores. The second was to test Double Up as a year-round in select locations instead of the current seasonal format. The last---and arguably most difficult and important---was to shift away from the tokens to electronic processing of Double Up transactions. Across these three dimensions, the efficacy of Double Up is to be measured by how much it increasing the amount of fruits and vegetables (produce) purchased by customers who use SNAP benefits.

The Fair Food Network started testing and gathering data from grocery stores implementing Double Up in 2014. The mechanisms used to implement Double Up varies across grocery stores and chains, as does the produce offered and customer demographics. One of FFN's partners largest partners, a Michigan grocery retail and distribution company, piloted the program in 2 of its stores in 2014. The company has since expanded to 5 stores in 2015 and then to 17 of 62 stores in 2016. Rapid scaling was possible due to the point-of-sale technology used by the company to implement Double Ups across its stores. It provides, to date, the best case study of scaling Double Up across numerous grocery stores that span different geographic areas and populations for a specific incentive mechanism. Data from 2014 - 2016 will also be provided from another 15 stores where Double Up was not implement.

The availability of these data will provide an unprecedented look into how SNAP shoppers respond to targeted financial incentives. No research has been done on food incentives specifically tailored towards SNAP shoppers where behavior was analyzed via transactions as opposed to surveys (see [@bartlett_evaluation_2014]). Furthermore, no research has been done where the financial incentive was this large.
