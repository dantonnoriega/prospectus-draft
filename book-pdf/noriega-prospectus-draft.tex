Chapter 1 is an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Double Up Food
Bucks (Double Up) program. ``Effectiveness'' will be defined by the
change in total sales and volume of produce sold within a subset of
grocery stores that implement Double Up (treatment group). The control
group comprises 15 stores where Double Up was not implemented. A
difference-in-difference between stores using Double Up (treatment) and
those without (control) will be used to measure the size of the effect.

The broader policy concern is that of of improving health and food
equity of SNAP participants through targeted fruit and vegetables
subsidies. The focal point will be on the
\href{http://www.doubleupfoodbucks.org/}{\emph{Double Up Food Bucks}}
program run by the non-profit \emph{Fair Food Network} based out of
Michigan. A comparison will be made with another subsidy program called
the \emph{Healthy Incentives Pilot} (HIP). I will argue how and why my
results from the Double Up program are more realistic and dependable
than those from HIP. However, I will remain neutral on whether
subsidizing fruit and vegetable purchases lead to improved health
outcomes.

Chapter 2 is a comparison of 3 different mechanisms for distributing
Double Up: paper coupon, Loyalty card, and automatic discount. {[}TK
need to write more{]}.

Chapter 3 is an attempt to model the consumption cycle of SNAP
participants who receive benefits under the MI benefits schedule. The
neoclassical assumption is \emph{consumption smoothing}. The data
displays different behavior---something more hyperbolic, with benefits
being consumed at a high rate soon after being received. The two
models---neoclassical and hyperbolic---will be constructed then
calibrated using transaction data from 3 independent stores in MI where
we can identify SNAP transactions.

program}\label{an-evaluation-of-the-double-up-food-bucks-program}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Unhealthy eating is expensive. Obesity, heart disease, and other
metabolic risk factors (stroke, type II diabetes, etc) are chronic
conditions that account for more than 332.77 billion dollars annually in
health care expenditures \citep{chatterjee_checkup_2014}. More
importantly, diseases linked to poor diet account for hundreds of
thousands of death each year. Heart disease alone is the leading cause
of death for all persons in the US, with stroke fifth and diabetes
seventh \citep{national_center_for_health_statistics_health_2015}.
Improving dietary health of American households has therefore become an
ever-increasing priority for the United States.

Obesity and heart disease rates vary by income, affecting more
low-income families than middle- and high-income families. Research on
the dietary patterns of households receiving Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance (SNAP) benefits has found that they are significantly
\emph{less} likely to meet USDA dietary guidelines than the average US
household and much \emph{more} likely to consume unhealthy foods
\citep{andreyeva_dietary_2015, nguyen_supplemental_2015, wolfson_fruit_2015}.
This nutritional disparity is driven by many factors, but the most
consequential is undoubtedly lack of income.

SNAP is first and foremost an anti-hunger program, not health and
nutrition program. To qualify, a household must be sufficiently budget
constrained that hunger is considered likely without cash assistance. As
a consequence, SNAP beneficiaries can often not afford the luxury of
substituting healthy foods for unhealthy foods when unhealthy foods are
cheaper and more abundant. Lack of income, therefore, forces SNAP
beneficiaries to often make costly trade-offs between hunger and health
{[}TK Need reference{]}.

Economic theory suggests that behavior can be altered through financial
incentives. {[}TK list off incentive research{]}.

In the past few years, some non-profit programs have started testing
financial incentives as a way to encourage SNAP eligible families to buy
healthier foods. Of specific interest is Double Up Food Bucks (Double
Up), an incentives-based program. Double Up doubles the purchasing power
of SNAP recipients buying produce. Dollars spent on Michigan produce are
matched up to \$20 dollars but the matching funds can only be used to
purchase more fruits and vegetables.

Initially only available at farmer's markets, Double Up began expanding
into supermarkets in 2013. This expansion accelerated in 2014 with a 5
million dollar grant from the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive
(FINI). Double Up is now being implemented across numerous stores in the
Michigan area, with similar programs being launched and funded in
numerous other states. The success of the program---whether it increases
the volume of fresh fruits and vegetables purchased by SNAP
shoppers---depends heavily on the collection of transaction data from
stores implementing (and not implementing) Double Up. These data are
slowly becoming available to researchers, providing an exciting and
unprecedented opportunity to better understand how financial incentives
work as a public health and policy tool.

\subsection{The Double Up Food Bucks
Program}\label{the-double-up-food-bucks-program}

The non-profit organization Fair Food Networks (FFN) launched the Double
Up Food Bucks program in 2009 in Detroit, Michigan. The intention of the
program was to get more low-income families visiting and participating
in local Detroit farmers markets. The mechanism for increasing
participation was a financial incentive: a dollar-for-dollar matching
subsidy for fruits and vegetables. This subsidy was accessible only to
low-income families receiving SNAP benefits, who could exchange up to
\$20 of their benefits for a wooden token that could be used on up to
\$40 worth of locally grown, fresh produce.

Double Up program was considered successful given it had expanded to
more than 150 farmers markets in 2014 from just 5 farmers markets in
2009. SNAP benefits have been used more than 200,000 times to purchase
fresh produce, with more than 10,000 first time SNAP customers visiting
farmers markets in 2013 alone \citep{fair_food_network_double_2014}. The
program is considered by Fair Food Network to be a ``three-fold'' win
given that the program helps local low-income families buy more fresh
produce, provides new customers for local farmers, and stimulates the
local food economy. Relative to farmers markets in other states, Double
Up appears to have helped attract substantially more SNAP dollars (\$1.7
million in Michigan versus \$307,000 in Illinois, the second largest).

However, successful expansion into supermarkets and grocery stores is
critical. Approximately three-quarters of all SNAP benefits in 2009 were
used in supermarkets, super-centers, or small to large grocery stores
\citep{castner_benefit_2011}. Less than 7\% percent of SNAP benefits
were used at local farmers markets. The amount of SNAP benefits used in
local farmers markets has increased since 2009, but no where near the
growth necessary to reach the type of stores most frequented by
low-income families. If incentive programs like Double Up are going to
be considered as one of the USDA's many tools to increase food access
and combat obesity, then Double Up must be successfully implemented and
scaled across supermarkets and grocery stores. Double Up must also prove
it is effective in changing purchasing habits within the
supermarket/grocery store food environment.

A 5.17 million dollar FINI grant was awarded to Fair Food Network to
help it pilot three adjustments to Double Up Food Buck
\citep{usda_nifa_usda_2015}. The first is to expand the Double Up Food
Bucks program from farmers markets to retail supermarkets and grocery
stores. The second was to test Double Up as a year-round in select
locations instead of the current seasonal format. The last---and
arguably most difficult and important---was to shift away from the
tokens to electronic processing of Double Up transactions. Across these
three dimensions, the efficacy of Double Up is to be measured by how
much it increasing the amount of fruits and vegetables (produce)
purchased by customers who use SNAP benefits.

The Fair Food Network started testing and gathering data from grocery
stores implementing Double Up in 2014. The mechanisms used to implement
Double Up varies across grocery stores and chains, as does the produce
offered and customer demographics. One of FFN's partners largest
partners, a Michigan grocery retail and distribution company, piloted
the program in 2 of its stores in 2014. The company has since expanded
to 5 stores in 2015 and then to 17 of 62 stores in 2016. Rapid scaling
was possible due to the point-of-sale technology used by the company to
implement Double Ups across its stores. It provides, to date, the best
case study of scaling Double Up across numerous grocery stores that span
different geographic areas and populations for a specific incentive
mechanism.

\section{Data}\label{data}

These data come from a large grocery distributor and retailer serving
multiple grocery chains. Three years of data will be made available,
2014 through 2016. These data are transaction level and will include (at
least) store number, register, transaction ID, date and time of
purchase, payment type, item, dollars, and quantity.

Double Up implementation was considered for a single grocery chain. The
chain has more than 60 stores, 17 of which were selected as
``treatment'' stores (with Double Up). Of the remaining stores, data is
being made available from an addition 15 to serve as ``controls''. The
quotes here signify that these terms will be used as shorthand, but the
terminology is somewhat misleading. The use of ``treatment'' and
``control'' could lead one to think store assignment was random. It was
not.

{[}TK real specific details about the data e.g.~total transactions
observed etc.{]}

One important variable that will not be made available is a variable for
loyalty card numbers. The company's use of loyalty cards across its many
chains was an exciting prospect. Previous transaction data from smaller
independent grocery chains had no way linking purchases to a single
unique identifier over time because these smaller chains did not have
advanced point-of-sale systems.

In earlier conversations with the company, it was understood that
loyalty cards would be made available. However, months into working with
the company, we were informed that this was no longer possible.
According to the company's legal department, the company cannot share
any personal information about their customers. Unfortunately for us, in
the loyalty card contract signed by customers, the loyalty card number
itself is considered personal information, meaning loyalty card numbers
fall under the same legal category as phone numbers and home addresses.

\subsection*{Overview of Store Selection and
Expansion}\label{overview-of-store-selection-and-expansion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Overview of Store Selection and
Expansion}

How the 17 ``treatment'' stores and 15 ``control'' stores were selected
in 2016 is important. First and foremost, selection was \emph{not}
random. Stores were either selected by the company (13 of 17) or
self-selected into Double Up (4 of 17). Second, the 15 control stores
were selected \emph{after} the selection of the 17 treatment stores.
Data from all remaining stores was requested but the request was denied;
only 15 stores had been approved by the company's management. Finally,
and most importantly, the selection criteria for the 17 treatment stores
is \emph{observable}. The implications of this will be covered in more
detail in the \protect\hyperlink{methods}{Methods} section.

\subsection*{Selection and Expansion of Double Up
Stores}\label{selection-and-expansion-of-double-up-stores}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Selection and Expansion of Double Up
Stores}

The first 2 stores were piloted with Double Up in 2014. Both were in
geographically distinct areas (these will be referred to as
``\texttt{Node\ 0}'' and ``\texttt{Node\ 1}''). There was a small
expansion adding 3 more stores in 2015. The 3 stores were selected
because they were geographically close to the 2 original pilot stores (2
close to \texttt{Node\ 0}, 1 close to \texttt{Node\ 1}). The 5 stores
are referred to as the ``core''. These location of these 5 stores,
separated in two clusters, established the geographic constraints that
were then used to determine most of the additional stores in 2016.

Double Up was expanded to 12 more stores in 2016, totaling 17. Of those
12, 6 were selected due to their proximity to the 5 core stores, their
SNAP EBT\footnote{Electronic Benefit Transfer.} sales figures, and
similarity in surrounding demographics (high population density, more
African-American). In other words, 9 of the 17 stores---excluding the
initial 2 pilot stores-----were selected on a set of \emph{observable}
characteristics. The remaining 6 stores were not.

Of the remaining 6 stores, 4 asked if they could be included in the
program. These stores \emph{self-selected} into Double Up, making these
stores fundamentally distinct. They were considered, and then included,
only because they fell within the ``Top 50''. The final 2 stores were
selected by the company for ``strategic business decision''. The best
interpretation of this is that the company thought that Double Up would
provide a competitive edge to the 2 included stores given some internal
calculus. How the company came to this decision is \emph{unknown} and
therefore \emph{unobserved}.

Table \ref{tab:store-class} helps understand the year by year expansion
of Double Up. Stores are classified as either \texttt{assigned},
\texttt{self-selected}, or \texttt{unobserved}. To be \texttt{assigned}
means a stores participation in Double Up was determined (assigned) by
the company; \texttt{self-selected} means the store asked the company to
participate; \texttt{unobserved} means that the company selected the
store to participate in Double Up but for unknown and unobserved
reasons. Capital letters (i.e.~A, B, C) were assigned to each store for
easy reference but otherwise have no meaningful interpretation.

\subsection*{Expansion on Observables}\label{expansion-on-observables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Expansion on Observables}

An example expansion on \emph{observables} (using fake data) can be seen
in Figure \ref{fig:dufb-expansion}. In the top frame, one can see two
blue dots. These blue dots simulate the first two pilot stores in 2014.
The left blue dot is \texttt{Node\ 0} and the right blue dot is
\texttt{Node\ 1}. The gray zones represents areas of higher population
density. Dark gray is considered \emph{urban}, defined as having a
population density of 1500 persons or more per square mile. The light
gray are small towns and cities, more densely populated than very rural
areas, but could not be considered \emph{urban}. The expansion in 2015
(middle frame) proceeds to the stores closest to the original pilot
stores. The expansion continues to 6 more stores in 2016 (bottom frame)
away from the nodes but also along areas of higher population density.

Not conveyed in Figure \ref{fig:dufb-expansion} is that the 2015 and
2016 expansions also move through stores that happen to be ``highly
ranked''---that is, have relatively higher SNAP EBT sales.\footnote{All
  stores within the chain were ranked by SNAP EBT sales as a percentage
  of total sales.} Also not conveyed is the fact that there is a strong
correlation between geography, population density, racial composition,
and SNAP EBT sales. The 2015 expansion to the most nearby stores also
meant that it was an expansion to stores with high SNAP EBT sales in
densely populated, African-American neighborhoods. The 2016 Double Up
expansion was more explicit given that set of feasible stores
substantially increases as one moves away from each node. Double Up
stores were thus specifically selected not just by geographic proximity,
but also by SNAP EBT sales ranking and demographic compositions similar
to the initial 2014 stores.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{figures/expansion-v} 

}

\caption{Example expansion over time from 2014 to 2016 (top to bottom) using fake data. Blue dots denote stores with Double Up, pink dots denote without. Gray sectors denote higher population density. The initial nodes can be seen in the top (2014) frame.}\label{fig:dufb-expansion}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Selection of Control
Stores}\label{selection-of-control-stores}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Selection of Control Stores}

Ideally, all remaining stores would have been available to use as a
control group but the company only approved that data be released for 15
stores. This left the added---and incredibly important---step of
selecting the control stores since the company approved, but did not
explicitly select, the 15 stores.

Selecting the control stores proceeded in two steps. First, stores that
either self-selected or were selected using some unobservable criteria
were matched using \emph{Coarsened Exact Matching} (CEM)
\citep{iacus_causal_2011}. Second, stores assigned Double Up were pooled
with nearby control stores and then scored using a linear probability
model. Each step is explained in detail.

\subsubsection*{Step 1: Coarsened Exact
Matching}\label{step-1-coarsened-exact-matching}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 1: Coarsened Exact Matching}

The 6 stores classified as \texttt{self-selected} or \texttt{unobserved}
(store \texttt{L} through \texttt{Q}; see Table \ref{tab:store-class})
were compared against all possible control stores for matches. Matching
was done across 5 dimensions: race, income, population density, store
attributes, store EBT sales. One variable per dimension was selected:
percentage of population that is African-American (zip code level);
people per square mile (zip code level); median income for people who
have received SNAP or similar assistance (zip code level); the number of
associates employed in each store; and the percentage of total stores
sales attributed to EBT/SNAP.

Of the 6 stores (\texttt{L\ -\ Q}), only 3 produced viable matches.
However, each of the 3 matched stores had matched to more than one
control stores. The closest stores, by driving distance, were selected
as the tie-breaker for each matched store. Stores were sufficiently far
apart, with very sparsely populated areas between, that ``spill-over''
was considered unlikely. That is, it is considered unlikely that a
shopper near a store without Double Up would opt to drive 30 or more
minutes to shop at the store \emph{with} Double Up.

This left 12 stores to be allotted to the control group and 3 treatment
stores to be effectively discarded.

\subsubsection*{Step 2: Scoring via Linear Probability
Model}\label{step-2-scoring-via-linear-probability-model}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Step 2: Scoring via Linear
Probability Model}

Assignment to treatment and control can be perfectly determined since we
know and observe the criteria used for assignment: geographic distance
from an initial store (node), SNAP EBT sales rank, and
demographics---specifically population density and percentage
African-American. A scoring function was created by fitting a linear
probability model to all stores within 140 kilometers of the two initial
pilot stores.

\[
\begin{aligned}
     D  &= f(\matr{X}) +  \epsilon \\
            &= \matr{X}  \beta +  \epsilon \\
     \text{ where }s  &= \matr{X} \hat{ \beta}
\end{aligned}
\]

The fitted values of the model were used as the score and the top 12
scoring control stores were then selected

Empirical methods will vary by groups of stores.
